They plan to achieve orbit by building a sort of space elevator: a giant tower of blocks.  They have K (1 <= K <= 400) different types of blocks with which to build the tower.  Each block of type i has height h_i (1 <= h_i <= 100) and is available in quantity c_i (1 <= c_i <= 10).  Due to possible damage caused by cosmic rays, no part of a block of type i can exceed a maximum altitude a_i (1 <= a_i <= 40000).<br><br>Help the cows build the tallest space elevator possible by stacking blocks on top of each other according to the rules.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: A single integer, K<br><br>* Lines 2..K+1: Each line contains three space-separated integers: h_i, a_i, and c_i. Line i+1 describes block type i.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: A single integer H, the maximum height of a tower that can be built</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3

Stacking 4 blocks of type 2 and 3 of type 1 is not legal, since the top of the last type 1 block would exceed height 40.</div><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>USACO 2005 March Gold</a></div></td></tr></table>
