The expressions may include the following operators: ! for not , & for and, | for or , the use of parenthesis for operations grouping is also allowed. <br><br>To perform the evaluation of an expression, it will be considered the priority of the operators, the not having the highest, and the or the lowest. The program must yield V or F , as the result for each expression in the input file. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The expressions are of a variable length, although will never exceed 100 symbols. Symbols may be separated by any number of spaces or no spaces at all, therefore, the total length of an expression, as a number of characters, is unknown. <br><br>The number of expressions in the input file is variable and will never be greater than 20. Each expression is presented in a new line, as shown below. <br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test expression, print "Expression " followed by its sequence number, ": ", and the resulting value of the corresponding test expression. Separate the output for consecutive test expressions with a new line. <br><br>Use the same format as that shown in the sample output shown below. <br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">( V | V ) & F & ( F| V)
!V | V & V & !F & (F | V ) & (!F | F | !V & V)
(F&F|V|!V&!F&!(F|F&V))</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">Expression 1: F
Expression 2: V
Expression 3: V</pre><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>MÃ©xico and Central America 2004</a></div></td></tr></table>
