Initially all locations are empty. The following operation must be supported by the collection: Insert(L, K), where L is the location in the array and K is some positive integer value. <br>The operation must be processed as follows: <br><ul><li>If A[L] is empty, set A[L] ← K. <br><li>If A[L] is not empty, perform Insert(L + 1, A[L]) and after that set A[L] ← K. </ul><br>Given N integer numbers L1 , L2 , . . . , LN you have to output the contents of the array after a sequence of the following operations: <br><blockquote>Insert(L1 , 1) <br>Insert(L2 , 2) <br>. . . <br>Insert(LN , N)</blockquote></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains N --- the number of Insert operations and M --- the maximal position that can be used in the Insert operation (1 <= N <= 131 072, 1 <= M <= 131 072). <br>Next line contains N integer numbers L i that describe Insert operations to be performed (1 <= Li <= M ). </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output the contents of the array after a given sequence of Insert operations. On the first line print W --- the number of the greatest location that is not empty. After that output W integer numbers --- A[1], A[2], . . . , A[W ]. Output zeroes for empty locations. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5 4
