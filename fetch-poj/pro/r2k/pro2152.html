Cities are connected by highways, and there is exact one path between two different cities. Recently country Z often caught fire, so the government decided to build some firehouses in some cities. Build a firehouse in city K cost W(K). W for different cities may be different. If there is not firehouse in city K, the distance between it and the nearest city which has a firehouse, can’t be more than D(K). D for different cities also may be different. To save money, the government wants you to calculate the minimum cost to build firehouses.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of input contains a single integer T representing the number of test cases. The following T blocks each represents a test case.<br><br>The first line of each block contains an integer N (1 < N <= 1000). The second line contains N numbers separated by one or more blanks. The I-th number means W(I) (0 < W(I) <= 10000). The third line contains N numbers separated by one or more blanks. The I-th number means D(I) (0 <= D(I) <= 10000). The following N-1 lines each contains three integers u, v, L (1 <= u, v <= N，0 < L <= 1000), which means there is a highway between city u and v of length L.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case output the minimum cost on a single line.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5
