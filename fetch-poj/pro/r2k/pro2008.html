Your goal is to select a team of as many calves as possible from this group. There is only one constraint the team must satisfy: the height H and weight W of each calf on the team must obey the following inequality:<br><center>A*(H-h) + B*(W-w) <= C</center><br>where h and w are the minimum height and weight values over all calves on the team, and A, B and C are supplied positive integral constants less than 10,000.   Compute the maximum number of calves on the team.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: A single integer, N<br><br>* Line 2: Three space-separated integers, A, B and C<br><br>* Lines 3..N+2: Two space-separated integers: respectively the height and weight of a calf<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: One integer, the maximum number of calves on the team.<br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">8
