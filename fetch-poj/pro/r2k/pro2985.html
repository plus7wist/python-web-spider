He possesses lots of cats in his home. Because the number of cats is really huge, Newman wants to group some of the cats. To do that, he first offers a number to each of the cat (1, 2, 3, &hellip;, <i>n</i>). Then he occasionally combines the group cat <i>i</i> is in and the group cat <i>j</i> is in, thus creating a new group. On top of that, Newman wants to know the size of the <i>k</i>-th biggest group at any time. So, being a friend of Newman, can you help him?</p></span></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>1st line: Two numbers <i> N</i> and <i> M</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i>, <i>M</i> &le; 200,000), namely the number of cats and the number of operations.</p><p>2nd to (<i>m</i> + 1)-th line: In each line, there is number <i> C</i> specifying the kind of operation Newman wants to do. If <i>C</i> = 0, then there are two numbers <i> i</i> and <i> j</i> (1 &le; <i>i</i>, <i>j</i> &le; <i>n</i>) following indicating Newman wants to combine the group containing the two cats (in case these two cats are in the same group, just do nothing); If <i>C</i> = 1, then there is only one number <i>k</i> (1 &le; <i>k</i> &le; the current number of groups) following indicating Newman wants to know the size of the <i>k</i>-th largest group.</p></span></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>For every operation &ldquo;1&rdquo; in the input, output one number per line, specifying the size of the kth largest group.</p></span></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">10 10
