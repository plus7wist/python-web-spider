Unfortunately, it is not possible to grow barley on the full area of the plain, as several nuclear plants have recently been built, and you cannot grow barley near a nuclear plant (since you do not want to produce giant-size, aggressive, man-eating barley-mutants). Your task is to write a program that determines the size of the area that can be used for growing barley. <br><br>The Great Plain of Algorithmia is an n x m km<sup>2</sup> rectangle, the coordinates of the four corners being (0, 0),(0, m),(n, 0) and (n, m) . There are two types of nuclear plants: small and large. You are not allowed to grow barley within 0.58km of a small nuclear plant or within 1.31km of a large nuclear plant. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each block begins with a line containing four integers: 1 &le; n, m &le; 10000 describe the size of the plain, ks &le; 100 is the number of small nuclear plants, and kl &le; 100 is the number of large nuclear plants. The next ks lines describe the coordinates of the small nuclear plants, each line contains two integers 0 &le; x &le; n and 0 &le; y &le; m . The next kl lines describe the large nuclear plants in a similar fashion. <br><br>The input is terminated by a block with n = m = ks = kl = 0 . <br><br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, you have to output a single line containing the area that can be used for growing barley. This number should be a real value with two digits of precision. To avoid rounding problems, we accept solutions with a maximum of &plusmn;0.01 error. <br><br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">10 10 2 2
