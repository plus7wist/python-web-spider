Each test case consists of two equations, each on a separate line. An empty line separates cases. An equation consists of two or more terms separated by addition, subtraction, or equality operators. A term is an integer, or a variable name (x or y) optionally preceded by a minus sign or an integer coefficient. There is exactly one equality operator. All operators are surrounded by spaces, and there are no spaces within terms.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each case, print two lines, giving the values of x and y as rationals in simplest terms. If x or y has no unique rational value such that both equations hold, print "don't know" for its value. Print an empty line between cases. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">7
2x + 3y = x
5 = x + y + 3

2x + 3y = 0
10x = -15y

2x + 3y = 0
10x = -15y + 1

x = 1
3x = 6y

2x = 3x + -x + y
x + y = x + y

2x = -3
-2y = 3

1 = 2
x = 3
