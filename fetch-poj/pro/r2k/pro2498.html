But they're not just any numbers. Only those that have a checksum with a zero as last digit can be valid ids.<br><b>Problem</b><br>Here's how to compute the checksum of an id number. Multiply the digits from back to front (!) with repeating factors 9, 3, 7. Then simply add the products. Example:<br><pre><br>id number :  1  3  9  0  2  7  2<br>factors   :  9  7  3  9  7  3  9<br>products  :  9 21 27  0 14 21 18</pre><br>Here the checksum is 9+21+27+0+14+21+18 = 110. The last digit is zero, so the id is valid. Sometimes students have very bad handwriting and the teaching assistents have a hard time identifying the idâ€™s. You're asked to help in special cases, where exactly one digit is unreadable. In that case, the missing digit can be computed (there's always exactly one correct digit, thanks to 9, 3 and 7 being relatively prime to 10). Note that the students always begin concentrated and thus the first digit will always be readable (and not zero).</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line contains the number of scenarios. Each scenario is a single line that contains an id number with one digit replaced by a question mark and with six or seven digits length.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output for every scenario begins with a line containing "Scenario #i:", where i is the number of the scenario starting at 1. Then print a single line containing the correct id number. Terminate the output for the scenario with a blank line.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4
