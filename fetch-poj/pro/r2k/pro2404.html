Behind his house is a park with a large network of jogging trails connecting water stations. Gord wants to find the shortest jogging route that travels along every trail at least once. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input consists of several test cases. The first line of input for each case contains two positive integers: n <= 15, the number of water stations, and m < 1000, the number of trails. For each trail, there is one subsequent line of input containing three positive integers: the first two, between 1 and n, indicating the water stations at the end points of the trail; the third indicates the length of the trail, in cubits. There may be more than one trail between any two stations; each different trail is given only once in the input; each trail can be travelled in either direction. It is possible to reach any trail from any other trail by visiting a sequence of water stations connected by trails. Gord's route may start at any water station, and must end at the same station. A single line containing 0 follows the last test case. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each case, there should be one line of output giving the length of Gord's jogging route.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 5
