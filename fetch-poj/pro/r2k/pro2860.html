He has <i>N</i> identical blocks and a box with K rooms for <i>M</i> blocks at most. That is, he can pile up <i>M</i> blocks, at most, into one of the <i>K</i> rooms, but can't more than M blocks. For example, if <i>N</i> = 3, <i>K</i> = 3, <i>M</i> = 2, there are seven ways to pile up all blocks:<br><br><center><img src=images/2860_1.png></center><br><p>Given two states of blocks, He wants to know how many times he should move blocks one by one, to change the initial state into the final state. For instance, he can choose one block from any of 3 rooms (A, B, C), and then move it into another room. Of course, he cannot put more than <i>M</i> blocks at the room.</span></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang=en-us><p>First line has three positives integers, <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 30), <i>M</i> (1 &le; <i>M</i> &le; 4), and <i>K</i> (1 &le; <i>K</i> &le; 10). Each of next <i>K</i> lines contains the number of blocks piled at the room. This represents the initial state.
