One part of the game requires that the players count the number of squares that are formed by these lines. For example, in the figure shown below, there are 3 squares, 2 of size 1 and 1 of size 2 , so the total number of squares is 3. (The "size" of a square is the number of lines segments required to form a side.) <br><center><img src=images/2445_1.jpg></center><br>Your task is to write a program to count the number of all the possible squares. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input represents a series of game boards. Each board consists of a description of a square array of n ^ 2 dots (where 2 <= n <= 1500) and some interconnecting horizontal and vertical lines. A record of a single board with n ^ 2 dots and m (m <= 300000 )interconnecting lines is formatted as follows: <br><br>Line 1: "n" the number of dots in a single row or column.<br>Line 2: "m" the number of interconnecting lines.<br>Each of the next m lines are one of following two types:<br>		<br>"H i j k" (1 <= i, j <= n, k >0, j + k <= n) indicates a horizontal line of length k from the dot in row i, column j to the dot in row i, column j + k.<br><br>or<br><br>"V i j k" (1 <= i, j <= n, k >0, i + k <= n) indicates a vertical line of length k from the dot in row i, column j to the dot in row i + k, column j.<br><br>The end of input is indicated by end-of-file. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each record print only one integer, which is the number of squares.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4
