He can overlap planks and the ends do not need to be anchored on the ground. However, he must cover each pool completely.<br><br>Given the mud pools, help FJ figure out the minimum number of planks he needs in order to completely cover all the mud pools.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and L<br><br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers: s_i and e_i (0 <= s_i < e_i <= 1,000,000,000) that specify the start and end points of a mud pool along the road. The mud pools will not overlap.  These numbers specify points, so a mud pool from 35 to 39 can be covered by a single board of length 4. Mud pools at (3,6) and (6,9) are not considered to overlap.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: The miminum number of planks FJ needs to use.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3 3
