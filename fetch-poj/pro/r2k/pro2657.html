Fields are successively numbered from1 to N clockwise. In some fields there may be obstacles.<br><br>Player starts on a field marked with number 1. His goal is to reach a given field marked with number Z. The only way of moving is a clockwise jump of length K. The only restriction is that the fields the player may jump to should not contain any obstacle.<br><br>For example, if N = 13, K = 3 and Z = 9, the player can jump across the fields 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 3, 6 and 9, reaching his goal under condition that none of these fields is occupied by an obstacle.<br><br>Your task is to write a program that finds the smallest possible number K.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">First line of the input consists of integers N, Z and M, 2 <= N <= 1000, 2 <= Z <= N, 0 <= M <= N - 2. N represents number of fields on the game-board and Z is a given goal-field.<br><br>Next line consists of M different integers that represent marks of fields having an obstacle. It is confirmed that fields marked 1 and Z do not contain an obstacle.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output a line contains the requested number K described above.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">9 7 2
