There are three underpasses and our 18-wheeler will fit through all of them, so just keep that motor running!" <br><br>"We're not going to make it, I say!" <br><br>So, which is it: will there be a very messy accident on Interstate 10, or is Thibodeaux just letting the sound of his own wheels drive him crazy? </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input to this problem will consist of a single data set. The data set will be formatted according to the following description. <br><br>The data set will consist of a single line containing 3 numbers, separated by single spaces. Each number represents the height of a single underpass in inches. Each number will be between 0 and 300 inclusive. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There will be exactly one line of output. This line will be: <br><br>   NO CRASH<br><br>if the height of the 18-wheeler is less than the height of each of the underpasses, or: <br>   CRASH X<br><br>otherwise, where X is the height of the first underpass in the data set that the 18-wheeler is unable to go under (which means its height is less than or equal to the height of the 18-wheeler). <br>The height of the 18-wheeler is 168 inches. <br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">180 160 170
