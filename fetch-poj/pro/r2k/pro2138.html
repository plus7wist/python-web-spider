Like everyone else, they are bored and are playing "travel games" to pass the time away.<br><br>In this travel game, the first cow thinks of a three letter word from the Sacred Travel Game Dictionary (STGD).  The next cow in line must add a letter to the word (at the beginning, between two letters, or at the end) to make another word in the STGD.  The cows are curious as to just how big the final word can be.<br><br>Given a dictionary of D (1 <= D <= 1000) words and a starting word, find any of the longest possible words that can be formed playing this travel game.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: The integer D followed by a space followed by a legal three letter word.<br><br>* Line 2 through D+1: Each line contains a legal word no longer than 80 characters, consisting only of lowercase letters, from the STGD.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A single line with the longest word that can be formed by extending the input seed.<br>The input ensure the correct result will be unique.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">9 cal
