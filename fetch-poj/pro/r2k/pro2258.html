Therefore, determining the longest road is not trivial (although human players usually see it immediately). <br>Compared to the original game, we will solve a simplified problem here: You are given a set of nodes (cities) and a set of edges (road segments) of length 1 connecting the nodes. <br>The longest road is defined as the longest path within the network that doesn't use an edge twice. Nodes may be visited more than once, though. <br><br>Example: The following network contains a road of length 12. <br><pre><br>o      o--o      o<br> \    /    \    /<br>  o--o      o--o<br> /    \    /    \<br>o      o--o      o--o<br>           \    /<br>            o--o<br></pre></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input will contain one or more test cases. <br>The first line of each test case contains two integers: the number of nodes n (2<=n<=25) and the number of edges m (1<=m<=25). The next m lines describe the m edges. Each edge is given by the numbers of the two nodes connected by it. Nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1. Edges are undirected. Nodes have degrees of three or less. The network is not neccessarily connected. <br>Input will be terminated by two values of 0 for n and m. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, print the length of the longest road on a single line.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3 2
