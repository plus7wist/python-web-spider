Students of course are very lazy, so they do not like to do their homework. On the other side, Mr. O'Cruel doesn't like lazy students. <br>Recently Andrew failed to do his homework again, so he was given a special task. If he doesn't do it, he will be expelled from his school. The task seems very easy, but it is very technical, so it would take a lot of time. Andrew is given a polynomial p(x) = a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup> + a<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup> + . . . + a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>0</sub> with integer coefficients. <br>He must calculate the value of the polynomial for k successive integer numbers starting from l. Of course writing all these numbers would require too much paper. So as a proof of completing the task, for each number x from l to l + k - 1 Andrew is asked to provide the sum of squares of m last digits in decimal notation of p(x). <br>Since Andrew is lazy, he doesn't want to do the task by himself. So he asks you to write the program that calculates the values requested. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains n, l, k, and m (0 <= n <= 10, 0 <= l <= 10<sup>1000</sup> , 1 <= k <= 1 000, 1 <= m <= 1 000). <br>The following n + 1 lines contain coefficients of the polynomial: a<sub>n</sub> , a<sub>n-1</sub> , . . . , a<sub>1</sub> , a<sub>0</sub> (0 <= a<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>1000</sup>). </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output k lines --- for x from l to l + k - 1 output the sum of squares of last m digits of p(x). </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3 0 10 2
