Whenever a knight moves, it is two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to this. The world of a knight is the chessboard he is living on. Our knight lives on a chessboard that has a smaller area than a regular 8 * 8 board, but it is still rectangular. Can you help this adventurous knight to make travel plans?<br><br><b>Problem</b><br>Find a path such that the knight visits every square once. The knight can start and end on any square of the board.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input begins with a positive integer n in the first line. The following lines contain n test cases. Each test case consists of a single line with two positive integers p and q, such that 1 <= p * q <= 26. This represents a p * q chessboard, where p describes how many different square numbers 1, . . . , p exist, q describes how many different square letters exist. These are the first q letters of the Latin alphabet: A, . . .</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output for every scenario begins with a line containing "Scenario #i:", where i is the number of the scenario starting at 1. Then print a single line containing the lexicographically first path that visits all squares of the chessboard with knight moves followed by an empty line. The path should be given on a single line by concatenating the names of the visited squares. Each square name consists of a capital letter followed by a number.<br>If no such path exist, you should output impossible on a single line.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3
1 1
2 3
4 3</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">Scenario #1:
A1

Scenario #2:
impossible
