World Nation has <i>N</i> cities and some of cities are connected, but others not. The general wants to know how many ways he can select 6 cities and finally build 6 towers. However, one thing is necessary: if he chooses 6 cities A, B, C, D, E, and F, they have to be connected with their neighbors. If we draw 6 cities as 6 points on a circle, we can easily realize each of 6 cities has two neighbors, one for clockwise and another for counterclockwise. For example, A has two neighbors, B and F. So the general needs to consider about the order of 6 cities because to choose (A-B-C-D-E-F-A) is not the same as to choose (A-B-D-C-E-F-A). Nevertheless, the choice (A-B-C-D-E-F-A) is the same as (A-F-E-D-C-B-A) and/or as (B-C-D-E-F-A-B) because they can be made by reversion or rotation.<p>Now, it is time to help the general.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang=en-us><p>The first line has a positive integer <i>N</i> (6 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 111), which indicates the number of cities. Information on connection of the cities is given by an adjacent-matrix: if city <i>A</i> and city <i>B</i> is connected, bits of <i>A</i>-row <i>B</i>-column and <i>B</i>-row <i>A</i>-column are 1. Otherwise, both are 0. There is no space in a line.</span></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>If the number of ways is <i>K</i>, just output <i>K</i> mod 9901 because <i>K</i> can be very large.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">6

For 7 cities, the answer is 420.</div><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>Hooyeon Lee (ltdtl@POJ)</a></div></td></tr></table>
