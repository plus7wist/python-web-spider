Over the next N (1 <= N <= 10,000) weeks, the price of milk and labor will fluctuate weekly such that it will cost the company C_i (1 <= C_i <= 5,000) cents to produce one unit of yogurt in week i.  Yucky's factory, being well-designed, can produce arbitrarily many units of yogurt each week.<br><br>Yucky Yogurt owns a warehouse that can store unused yogurt at a constant fee of S (1 <= S <= 100) cents per unit of yogurt per week. Fortuitously, yogurt does not spoil.  Yucky Yogurt's warehouse is enormous, so it can hold arbitrarily many units of yogurt.<br><br>Yucky wants to find a way to make weekly deliveries of Y_i (0 <= Y_i <= 10,000) units of yogurt to its clientele (Y_i is the delivery quantity in week i). Help Yucky minimize its costs over the entire N-week period. Yogurt produced in week i, as well as any yogurt already in storage, can be used to meet Yucky's demand for that week.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and S.<br><br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers: C_i and Y_i.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: Line 1 contains a single integer: the minimum total cost to satisfy the yogurt schedule.
