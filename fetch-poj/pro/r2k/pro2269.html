On planning you notice that you have to do a lot of operations with sets of friends. There is one group which consist of Arthur, Biene and Clemens. Then there is a group of friends you know from snowboarding which consists of Daniel, Ernst, Frida and Gustav. If you want to invite them both, the resulting party group consists of g1 + g2 (the result is the union of both groups). Then you can compute the intersection of the two groups g1 * g2, which consists of the empty set. Maybe you want to invite a group g1, but excluding all members of an other group g2, which is written as g1 - g2. <br>Intersection (*) has precedence over union (+) and set difference (-). All operations are left associative, which means that in A op1 B op2 C you first have to evaluate A op1 B (provided op1 and op2 have equal precedence). <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of one or more lines. Each line contains one expression that you have to evaluate. Expressions are syntactically correct and only consist of the characters: <br><ul><li>'{' and '}' <br><li>the elements 'A' to 'Z' meaning friend Arthur to Zora. <br><li>the operations '+', '-' and '*' <br><li>'(' and ')' for grouping operations <br><li>the newline character '\n' marking the end of an expression. </ul><br>A line is never longer than 255 characters.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output the resulting set in curly braces '{' and '}', each on a line of its own. Print elements of sets sorted alphabetically. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">{ABC}
