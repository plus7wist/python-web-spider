Interestingly, regardless of how many legs have differing lengths, it is always possible to saw an amount from some legs so as to make the table sit level on a flat surface without rocking. <br>Your job is to generalize this approach to a table with many legs equally spaced around the perimeter of a round table. You are to determine the total length of legs to cut so as to have the table sit level without rocking on a flat surface with not necessarily every leg touching the ground. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input consists of data for a number of tables. For each table, a line will give an integer t, between 3 and 50, indicating the number of legs on the table. t subsequent lines will give, in order around the table's circumference, the lengths of the legs in millimetres. Each leg is perpendicular to the table top. A line containing 0 follows the data for the last table. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Pick a strategy that cuts the least total length from all legs and print this amount as an integer number. Print a blank line between tables. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3
