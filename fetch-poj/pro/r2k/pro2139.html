If two distinct cows have been in a movie together, each is considered to be one 'degree' away from the other.  If a two cows have never worked together but have both worked with a third cow, they are considered to be two 'degrees' away from each other (counted as: one degree to the cow they've worked with and one more to the other cow).  This scales to the general case.<br><br>The N (2 <= N <= 300) cows are interested in figuring out which cow has the smallest average degree of separation from all the other cows. excluding herself of course. The cows have made M (1 <= M <= 10000) movies and it is guaranteed that some relationship path exists between every pair of cows.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M<br><br>* Lines 2..M+1: Each input line contains a set of two or more space-separated integers that describes the cows appearing in a single movie.  The first integer is the number of cows participating in the described movie, (e.g., Mi); the subsequent Mi integers tell which cows were.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: A single integer that is 100 times the shortest mean degree of separation of any of the cows.<br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 2
3 1 2 3
2 3 4
</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">100
