"Incredible! Impossible!", --- say all his classmates, --- "So many numbers! You must be a true genius!". <br>But Basil does not like that Alex becomes the most known person at the school. <br>--- "I say! I am Basil the greatest! Given a rectangular table n*m and the sums of rows and columns I will tell you a number of possible tables with non-negative integers satisfying these conditions". <br>--- "You boast! I bet five dollars you can't do it even for n*3", --- Alex says. <br>--- "I bet five that I can!", --- says Basil. <br>Tomorrow is the contest. Alex will create some tables with size n*3, and tell Basil the sums and the dimensions. All boys and girls do the stakes who will be the winner! <br>You are the friend of Alex. He wants to create some hard data sets for Basil, and he needs to have a method to calculate the answer. Because Alex can't solve such kind of tasks, he asked you to write a program that will do it for him. <br>Alex needs only last seventeen digits to check the answers. So you must calculate the number of possible tables taken modulo 10<sup>17</sup> . </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line contains four numbers: n, c1 , c2 , c3 , where n is the number of rows, ci are the sums of columns. n numbers follow, each is the sum of the corresponding row. n and all sums are non-negative integers. They are not greater than 125. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">On the first line output the number of possible tables taken modulo 10<sup>17</sup> . </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3 1 2 3
