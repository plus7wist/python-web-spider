In order to increase the auditorium, it were suggested to build several relay stations. N locations were selected as candidate sites for relay stations. Relay station placed in i-th location will cover a circular area with center in point (xi, yi) and radius ri, where center lies inside the area covered by the base station, (x0 - xi)<sup>2</sup> + (y0 - yi)<sup>2</sup> ≤ R<sup>2</sup>. <br><br>Your task is to select a subset of sites for relay stations so that: <br><ol><li>the covered areas for relays do not intersect (but may touch) one another, <br><li>the total area covered by base station and all relays is maximum possible. </ol></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input contains integer number N followed by real numbers x0 y0 R, followed by N triples of real numbers xi yi ri.<br>1 ≤ N ≤ 10, 0 ≤ xi, yi, x0, y0 ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ ri ≤ R ≤ 1000. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output should contain a single real number -- the maximal coverage area with the absolute error less than 10<sup>−2</sup>.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1 0 0 10
