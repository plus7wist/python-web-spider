He usually asks other people to play with him. He says that playing those games can show his extraordinary wit. Recently Urej takes a great interest in a new game, and Erif Nezorf becomes the victim. To get away from suffering playing such a dull game, Erif Nezorf requests your help. The game uses a rectangular paper that consists of W*H grids. Two players cut the paper into two pieces of rectangular sections in turn. In each turn the player can cut either horizontally or vertically, keeping every grids unbroken. After N turns the paper will be broken into N+1 pieces, and in the later turn the players can choose any piece to cut. If one player cuts out a piece of paper with a single grid, he wins the game. If these two people are both quite clear, you should write a problem to tell whether the one who cut first can win or not.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains only two integers W and H (2 <= W, H <= 200) in one line, which are the width and height of the original paper.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, only one line should be printed. If the one who cut first can win the game, print "WIN", otherwise, print "LOSE".</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2 2
