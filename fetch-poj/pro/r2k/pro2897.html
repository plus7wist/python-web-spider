We call a number that has this property when multiplied by n, an n-dramatic number. For instance, 102564 and 128205 are both 4-dramatic. Given two one-digit numbers n and k, the goal is to find the smallest n-dramatic number that its rightmost digit is k.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">On the first line of the input, there is an integer t, which is the number of cases that follow. Each test case, is on a line by itself, and contains two integers n and k, where 1 <= n <= 9, and 1 <= k <= 9.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output a single integer on a line by itself, which is the smallest n-dramatic number that its rightmost digit is k. If no such number exists, output 0 instead.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2
