This computer uses a processor with a small number of machine instructions. Furthermore, it is equipped with 32 byte of memory, one 8-bit accumulator (accu) and a 5-bit program counter (pc). The memory contains data as well as code, which is the usual von Neumann architecture. <br>The program counter holds the address of the instruction to be executed next. Each instruction has a length of 1 byte - the highest 3 bits define the type of instruction and the lowest 5 bits define an optional operand which is always a memory address (xxxxx). For instructions that don't need an operand the lowest 5 bits have no meaning (-----). Here is a list of the machine instructions and their semantics: <br><pre>000xxxxx   STA x   store the value of the accu into memory byte x<br>001xxxxx   LDA x   load the value of memory byte x into the accu<br>010xxxxx   BEQ x   if the value of the accu is 0 load the value x into the pc<br>011-----   NOP     no operation<br>100-----   DEC     subtract 1 from the accu<br>101-----   INC     add 1 to the accu<br>110xxxxx   JMP x   load the value x into the pc<br>111-----   HLT     terminate program</pre><br>In the beginning, program counter and accumulator are set to 0. After fetching an instruction but before its execution, the program counter is incremented. You can assume that programs will terminate.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input file contains several test cases. Each test case specifies the contents of the memory prior to execution of the program. Byte 0 through 31 are given on separate lines in binary representation. A byte is denoted by its highest-to-lowest bits. Input is terminated by EOF. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output on a line the value of the accumulator on termination in binary representation, again highest bits first. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">00111110
