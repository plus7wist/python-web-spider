The first day of the week is Monday. <br><li>Months of the year are arranged in the three rows separated by horizontal and vertical lines of spaces. Each row contains four months. The calendar margins are of 1 space from all sides. Therefore, the whole calendar has size of 73 by 28 characters. </ul><br>Note that January 1st, 1900 was Monday. Also note that the year is a leap year if its number is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or divisible by 400. For example, a part of the printed calendar from October to December 2002 looks like this: <br><pre>.OCTOBER...........NOVEMBER..........DECEMBER.........<br>....7.14.21.28........4.11.18.25........2..9.16.23.30.<br>.1..8.15.22.29........5.12.19.26........3.10.17.24.31.<br>.2..9.16.23.30........6.13.20.27........4.11.18.25....<br>.3.10.17.24.31........7.14.21.28........5.12.19.26....<br>.4.11.18.25........1..8.15.22.29........6.13.20.27....<br>.5.12.19.26........2..9.16.23.30........7.14.21.28....<br>.6.13.20.27........3.10.17.24........1..8.15.22.29....<br>......................................................</pre><br>The calendar was printed and then burned, with only a small rectangular piece left. Your program must determine to which of years from 1900 to 2100 this piece could belong. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains integer numbers N and M - the sizes of the piece, separated by spaces. The following M lines contain N characters each - the piece of calendar. 2 <= N, M <= 10 </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output file must contain an ordered list of year numbers, one year per line. If given piece could not belong to any calendar, output must contain a single integer 0 (zero). </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 4
