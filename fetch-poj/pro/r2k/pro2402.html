For example, the name "anna" is a palindrome. Numbers can also be palindromes (e.g. 151 or 753357). Additionally numbers can of course be ordered in size. The first few palindrome<br>numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, ... <br>The number 10 is not a palindrome (even though you could write it as 010) but a zero as leading digit is not allowed.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of a series of lines with each line containing one integer value i (1<= i <= 2*10^9 ). This integer value i indicates the index of the palindrome number that is to be written to the output, where index 1 stands for the first palindrome number (1), index 2 stands for the second palindrome number (2) and so on. The input is terminated by a line containing 0.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each line of input (except the last one) exactly one line of output containing a single (decimal) integer value is to be produced. For each input value i the i-th palindrome number is to be written to the output.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1
