The interior of the van is a rectangular box with width w, height h, and length l. The box has a sliding door that lifts but only to height H. That is, there is an immovable overhang of height H-h at the top of the door. <br>You have a large rectangular box that you wish to load on the truck. Can you get it on the truck subject to the following constraints: <br><ul><li>The box must fit through the door, tilting it forward or sideways (but not both) as necessary (see figure below). <br><li>The box must be placed with one side flat against the floor. <br><li>The box must be placed with one side flat against the front wall. <br><li>The door must close once the box is in place. </ul><br>You may assume there are no obstructions (such as a ceiling or the ground) outside the truck that might interfere with loading. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><img src=images/2468_1.jpg align=right>There are several test cases, each represented by two lines of input. The first line of each contains 4 integers: w, h, l, H. The next line contains 3 integers - the dimensions of the box.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, print "The box goes on the truck." if it is possible to load the box on the truck; otherwise print "The box will not go on the truck."
