Your task is to find a partition of a number m which occupies the k-th position in the lexicographically ordered sequence of all partitions of m into n elements. <br>The lexicographic ordering among the partitions of a number is defined as follows. For two partitions a and b of m into n elements such that a = [a1,...,an] and b = [b1,...,bn] we have a  <  b if and only if there exists an 1 <= i <= n such that for all j < i we have aj = bj and ai < bi. The sequence of all partitions is ordered in increasing lexicographic order and at the first we have the following sequence 1, 1, ... 1, m-n+1. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of input contains a number c giving the number of cases that follow. Each of the subsequent c lines contains three numbers: 1 <= m <= 220, 1 <= n <= 10 and 1 <= k which is not bigger than the number of partitions of m into n elements. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each input data set print the k-th partition of m into n elements. Each element of a partition is to be printed in a separate line. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2
