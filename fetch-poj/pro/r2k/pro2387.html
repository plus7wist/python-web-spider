Bessie needs her beauty sleep, so she wants to get back as quickly as possible.<br><br>Farmer John's field has N (2 <= N <= 1000) landmarks in it, uniquely numbered 1..N. Landmark 1 is the barn; the apple tree grove in which Bessie stands all day is landmark N.  Cows travel in the field using T (1 <= T <= 2000) bidirectional cow-trails of various lengths between the landmarks. Bessie is not confident of her navigation ability, so she always stays on a trail from its start to its end once she starts it.<br><br>Given the trails between the landmarks, determine the minimum distance Bessie must walk to get back to the barn.  It is guaranteed that some such route exists.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: Two integers: T and N<br><br>* Lines 2..T+1: Each line describes a trail as three space-separated integers. The first two integers are the landmarks between which the trail travels. The third integer is the length of the trail, range 1..100.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: A single integer, the minimum distance that Bessie must travel to get from landmark N to landmark 1.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5 5
