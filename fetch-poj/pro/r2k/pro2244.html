Germany's cities were enumerated randomly from 1 to n. Freiburg was number 1, Ulm was number 2, Karlsruhe was number 3, and so on in a purely random order.<br>Then a number m would be picked at random, and Internet access would first be cut off in city 1 (clearly the fairest starting point) and then in every mth city after that, wrapping around to 1 after n, and ignoring cities already cut off. For example, if n=17 and m=5, net access would be cut off to the cities in the order [1,6,11,16,5,12,2,9,17,10,4,15,14,3,8,13,7]. The problem is that it is clearly fairest to cut off Ulm last (after all, this is where the best programmers come from), so for a given n, the random number m needs to be carefully chosen so that city 2 is the last city selected. <br><br>Your job is to write a program that will read in a number of cities n and then determine the smallest integer m that will ensure that Ulm can surf the net while the rest of the country is cut off. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input will contain one or more lines, each line containing one integer n with 3 <= n < 150, representing the number of cities in the country.<br>Input is terminated by a value of zero (0) for n.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each line of the input, print one line containing the integer m fulfilling the requirement specified above.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3
