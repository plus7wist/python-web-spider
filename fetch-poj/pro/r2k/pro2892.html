Generally speaking, villages connected by tunnels lay in a line. Except the two at the ends, every village was directly connected with two neighboring ones.</p><p>Frequently the invaders launched attack on some of the villages and destroyed the parts of tunnels in them.

If some villages are severely isolated, restoration of connection must be done immediately!</p></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The first line of the input contains two positive integers <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> (<i>n</i>, <i>m</i> <span lang="en-us">&le;</span> 50,000) indicating the number of villages and events.
