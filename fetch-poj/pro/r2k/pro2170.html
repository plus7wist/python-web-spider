Lattice animals on a square lattice are especially popular subject of study and are also known as polyominoes. Polyomino is usually represented as a set of sidewise connected squares. Polyomino with n squares is called n-polyomino.<br>In this problem you are to find a number of distinct free n-polyominoes that fit into rectangle w*h. Free polyominoes can be rotated and flipped over, so that their rotations and mirror images are considered to be the same.<br>For example, there are 5 different pentominoes (5-polyominoes) that fit into 2*4 rectangle and 3 different octominoes (8-polyominoes) that fit into 3 * 3 rectangle.<br><center><img src=images/2170_1.jpg></center></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of a single line with 3 integer numbers n, w, and h (1 <= n <= 10, 1 <= w, h <= n).</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Write to the output a single integer number -- the number of distinct free n-polyominoes that fit into rectangle w * h.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5 5 5</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">12</pre><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>Northeastern Europe 2004</a></div></td></tr></table>
