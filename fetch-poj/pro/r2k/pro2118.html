An ACM-sequence of order k is an integer sequence defined by its first k terms a0, a1,...a<sub>k-1</sub> and a recurrence relation a<sub>n</sub>=Î£<sub>1<=i<=k</sub>a<sub>n-i</sub>b<sub>i</sub> mod 10 000 for n >= k, where the bi's are integer constants. The i-th oldest fireperson then gets rank ai. <br><br>Your task is to calculate the rank of the i-th fireperson, given parameters of the ACM-sequence and the number i. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of several instances. Each instance is described on a single line containing the following integers separated by a single space: k, a0, , a<sub>k-1</sub>, b1, , bk, i. Here 1 <= k <= 100 is the order of the sequence, 0 <= ai < 10 000 are the first k elements of the sequence, 0 <= bi < 10 000 are the multipliers and 0 <= i < 1 000 000 000 is the number of the element we ask for. <br><br>The input ends with a line containing a number 0.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output consists of several lines corresponding to the instances on the input. The l-th line contains a single integer ai which is the i-th element of the sequence described by the l-th input instance. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2 0 1 1 1 6
