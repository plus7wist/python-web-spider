One day, Alice draws a board with size M * N. She wants Bob to use a lot of cards with size 1 * 2 to cover the board. However, she thinks it too easy to bob, so she makes some holes on the board (as shown in the figure below). <br><center><img src=images/2446_1.jpg></center><br>We call a grid, which doesnâ€™t contain a hole, a normal grid. Bob has to follow the rules below:<br>1. Any normal grid should be covered with exactly one card.<br>2. One card should cover exactly 2 normal adjacent grids.<br><br>Some examples are given in the figures below:<br><center><img src=images/2446_2.jpg><br>A VALID solution.</center><br><center><img src=images/2446_3.jpg><br>An invalid solution, because the hole of red color is covered with a card.</center><br><center><img src=images/2446_4.jpg><br>An invalid solution, because there exists a grid, which is not covered.</center><br>Your task is to help Bob to decide whether or not the chessboard can be covered according to the rules above.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There are 3 integers in the first line: m, n, k (0 < m, n <= 32, 0 <= K < m * n), the number of rows, column and holes. In the next k lines, there is a pair of integers (x, y) in each line, which represents a hole in the y-th row, the x-th column.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">If the board can be covered, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 3 2
2 1
3 3
</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">YES</pre><h3>Hint</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><img src=images/2446_5.jpg><br>A possible solution for the sample input.</div><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>POJ Monthly</a>,charlescpp</div></td></tr></table>
