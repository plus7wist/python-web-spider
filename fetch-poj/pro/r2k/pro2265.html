She lives in a bee hive with thousands of other bees. This bee hive consists of many hexagonal honey combs where the honey is stored in. <br>But bee Maja has a problem. Willi told her where she can meet him, but because Willi is a male drone and Maja is a female worker they have different coordinate systems. <br><CENTER><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH><CENTER>Maja's Coordinate System</CENTER><TH>      <CENTER>Willi's Coordinate System</CENTER><TR><TD>Maja who often flies directly to a special honey comb has laid an advanced two dimensional grid over the whole hive.<TD>Willi who is more lazy and often walks around just numbered the cells clockwise starting from 1 in the middle of the hive. <TR><TD><IMG alt=Maja src=images/2265_1.jpg><TD><IMG alt=Willi src=images/2265_2.jpg></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER><br>Help Maja to convert Willi's system to hers. Write a program which for a given honey comb number gives the coordinates in Maja's system. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains one or more integers which represent Willi's numbers. Each number stands on its own in a separate line, directly followed by a newline. The honey comb numbers are all less than 100 000. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">You should output the corresponding Maja coordinates to Willi's numbers, each coordinate pair on a separate line. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1
