In the box, there are 12 different blocks, which are shown above. Tom is a boy who likes to do practice in intelligence, so he spends a whole afternoon in finishing two different rectangles with 3 * 20, which are shown below.<br><br>①⑤⑤⑤⑤⑨⑩⑩⑩⑥⑥⑧②②②②②③④④<br>①⑤⑿⑿⑨⑨⑨⑩⑥⑥⑦⑧⑧⑧⑾⑾③③③④<br>①①①⑿⑿⑿⑨⑩⑥⑦⑦⑦⑦⑧⑾⑾⑾③④④<br><br>①⑧⑦⑦⑦⑦⑥⑩⑨⑿⑿⑿②②②②②③④④<br>①⑧⑧⑧⑦⑥⑥⑩⑨⑨⑨⑿⑿⑤⑾⑾③③③④<br>①①①⑧⑥⑥⑩⑩⑩⑨⑤⑤⑤⑤⑾⑾⑾③④④<br><br>Tom is sure that these are the only solutions for 3 * 20, and he wants to know the number of solutions for 4 * 15, 5 * 12, ... Can you help him?<br><br>You should notice that if a solution will be the same as the other by some flip or rotate, these two solutions should be consider as the same.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There may be several test cases.
