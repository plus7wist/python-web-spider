(Amtel released a 64-bit computer in 2000, a 32-bit computer in 1990, a 16-bit computer in 1980, an 8-bit computer in 1970, and a 4-bit computer, its first, in 1960.) <br>Amtel will use a new benchmark - the Factstone - to advertise the vastly improved capacity of its new chips. The Factstone rating is defined to be the largest integer n such that n! can be represented as an unsigned integer in a computer word. <br>Given a year 1960 <= y <= 2160, what will be the Factstone rating of Amtel's most recently released chip? </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There are several test cases. For each test case, there is one line of input containing y. A line containing 0 follows the last test case. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output a line giving the Factstone rating. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1960
