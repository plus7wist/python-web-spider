No pair of points of the set S lies on the straight line parallel to some side of the parallelepiped A. <br><br>You are to find a parallelepiped G of the maximal volume such that all its sides are parallel to the edges of A, G completely lies in A (G and A may have common boundary points) and no point of S lies in G (but may lie on its side).</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line consists of the numbers u, v, w separated with a space. The second line contains an integer n. The third, ..., (n+2)-nd line – the numbers x(i), y(i), z(i)separated with a space. <br><br>The number n is written without a decimal point. All other numbers are written with not more than two digits after a decimal point (if a number is integer a decimal point may be omitted). All the input numbers are non-negative not greater than 1000.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">One number – the volume of G with two digits after a decimal point. If the true volume has more than two digitrs after a decimal point you should round off the result to two digits after a decimal opint according to the common mathematical rules.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1.0 1.0 1.0
