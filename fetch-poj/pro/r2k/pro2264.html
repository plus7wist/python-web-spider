Most times this method doesn't work, but sometimes, in very rare cases, a new fruit emerges that tastes like a mixture between both of them. <br><br>A big topic of discussion inside the company is "How should the new creations be called?" A mixture between an apple and a pear could be called an apple-pear, of course, but this doesn't sound very interesting. The boss finally decides to use the shortest string that contains both names of the original fruits as sub-strings as the new name. For instance, "applear" contains "apple" and "pear" (APPLEar and apPlEAR), and there is no shorter string that has the same property. <br>A combination of a cranberry and a boysenberry would therefore be called a "boysecranberry" or a "craboysenberry", for example. <br><br>Your job is to write a program that computes such a shortest name for a combination of two given fruits. Your algorithm should be efficient, otherwise it is unlikely that it will execute in the alloted time for long fruit names. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each line of the input contains two strings that represent the names of the fruits that should be combined. All names have a maximum length of 100 and only consist of alphabetic characters.<br>Input is terminated by end of file. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output the shortest name of the resulting fruit on one line. If more than one shortest name is possible, any one is acceptable. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">apple peach
ananas banana
pear peach
</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">appleach
bananas
