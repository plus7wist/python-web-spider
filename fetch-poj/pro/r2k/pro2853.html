This will be followed by <i>N</i> lines, one for each problem instance. Each problem line will have the problem number, a single space and the number to be written as a sequence of consecutive positive integers. The second number will be less than 2<sup>31</sup> (so will fit in a 32-bit integer).</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The output for each problem instance will be a single line containing the problem number, a single space and the number of ways the input number can be written as a sequence of consecutive positive integers.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">7
