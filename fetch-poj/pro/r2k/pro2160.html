He has a simple job -- he knocks up wooden boxes of different sizes to pack machinery for delivery to the customers. Each box is a rectangular parallelepiped. Ivan uses six rectangular wooden pallets to make a box. Each pallet is used for one side of the box.<br><center><img src=images/2160_1.jpg></center><br>Joe delivers pallets for Ivan. Joe is not very smart and often makes mistakes -- he brings Ivan pallets that do not fit together to make a box. But Joe does not trust Ivan. It always takes a lot of time to explain Joe that he has made a mistake.<br>Fortunately, Joe adores everything related to computers and sincerely believes that computers never make mistakes. Ivan has decided to use this for his own advantage. Ivan asks you to write a program that given sizes of six rectangular pallets tells whether it is possible to make a box out of them.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input consists of six lines. Each line describes one pallet and contains two integer numbers w and h (1 <= w, h <= 10 000) -- width and height of the pallet in millimeters respectively.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Write a single word "POSSIBLE" to the output file if it is possible to make a box using six given pallets for its sides. Write a single word "IMPOSSIBLE" if it is not possible to do so.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1345 2584
