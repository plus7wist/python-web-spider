The tip of the cone is located at (0, 0, h). Two points are given on the cone surface in conic coordinates. The conic coordinates of a point p lying on the surface of the cone are two numbers: the first, d, is the distance from the tip of the cone to p and the second, A < 360, is the angle in degrees between the plane y = 0 and the plane through points (0,0,0), (0,0,h) and p, measured counterclockwise from the direction of the x axis.<br><center><img src=images/2508_1.jpg></center><br>Given are two points p1 = (d1, A1) and p2 = (d2, A2) in the conic coordinates. What is the (shortest) distance between p1 and p2 measured on the surface of the cone? </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input is a sequence of lines.
