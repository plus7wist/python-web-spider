For an example, let us look at permutations.<br>A permutation of the integers 1 to n is an ordering of these integers. So the natural way to represent a permutation is to list the integers in this order. With n = 5, a permutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1. <br>However, there is another possibility of representing a permutation: You create a list of numbers where the i-th number is the position of the integer i in the permutation. Let us call this second possibility an inverse permutation. The inverse permutation for the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. <br>An ambiguous permutation is a permutation which cannot be distinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2 for example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same. To get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a program which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several test cases.<br>The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100000). Then a permutation of the integers 1 to n follows in the next line. There is exactly one space character between consecutive integers. You can assume that every integer between 1 and n appears exactly once in the permutation. <br>The last test case is followed by a zero. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case output whether the permutation is ambiguous or not.
