But unlike those in Egypt and Central America, they have triangular (not rectangular) foundation. That is, they are tetrahedrons in mathematical sense. In order to find out some important facts about the early society of the country (it is widely believed that the pyramid sizes are in tight connection with Farland ancient calendar), Mr. Archeo needs to know the volume of the pyramids. Unluckily, he has reliable data about their edge lengths only. Please, help him!</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The file contains six positive integer numbers not exceeding 1000 separated by spaces, each number is one of the edge lengths of the pyramid ABCD. The order of the edges is the following: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A real number -- the volume printed accurate to four digits after decimal point.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1000 1000 1000 3 4 5</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">1999.9938</pre><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>Northeastern Europe 2002</a>, Northern Subregion</div></td></tr></table>
