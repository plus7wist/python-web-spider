Until now scientists have found several those segments, the problem is how many kinds of DNA sequences of a species don't contain those segments.<br><br>Suppose that DNA sequences of a species is a sequence that consist of A, C, T and G，and the length of sequences is a given integer n.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">First line contains two integer m (0 <= m <= 10), n (1 <= n <=2000000000). Here, m is the number of genetic disease segment, and n is the length of sequences.<br><br>Next m lines each line contain a DNA genetic disease segment, and length of these segments is not larger than 10.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">An integer, the number of DNA sequences, mod 100000.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 3
