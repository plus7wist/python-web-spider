He justified his observations in a book titled Human behavior and the principle of least effort published in 1949. While Zipf's rationale has largely been discredited, the principle still holds, and others have afforded it a more sound mathematical basis. <br>You are to find all the words occurring n times in an English text. A word is a sequence of letters. Words are separated by non-letters. Capitalization should be ignored. A word can be of any length that an English word can be. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains a single positive integer n. Several lines of text follow which will contain no more than 10000 words. The text for each case is terminated by a single line containing EndOfText. EndOfText does not appear elsewhere in the input and is not considered a word. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output the words which occur n times in the input text, one word per line, lower case, in alphabetical order. If there are no such words in input, output the following line: <br>There is no such word.<br><br>Leave a blank line between cases. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2
