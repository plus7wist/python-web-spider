Your program must find such two (perhaps overlapping or even identical) rectangles, that they would contain all the 2s which are in matrix, but none of the 1s. If several solutions exist, the program must find a solution with minimal area of joined rectangles. For example, in the matrix <br><pre> 1 2 1 0<br> 2 0 2 2<br> 1 2 1 0</pre><br>these rectangles are (2,1)-(2,3) and (1,2)-(4,2), with the combined area of 6. <br><br><b>Constraints</b><br>1 ≤ N, M ≤ 50 </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input contains integers N and M followed by N * M matrix elements. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output must contain a single integer -- the minimal area, or -1 if no solution exists </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3 4
