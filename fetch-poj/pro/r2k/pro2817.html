You decide to try your hand at devising a new puzzle of your own.<br><br>Given a collection of N words, find an arrangement of the words that divides them among N lines, padding them with leading spaces to maximize the number of non-space characters that are the same as the character immediately above them on the preceding line. Your score for this game is that number. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input data will consist of one or more test sets.<br><br>The first line of each set will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 10) giving the number of words in the test case. The following N lines will contain the words, one word per line. Each word will be made up of the characters 'a' to 'z' and will be between 1 and 10 characters long (inclusive).<br><br>End of input will be indicated by a non-positive value for N . </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Your program should output a single line containing the maximum possible score for this test case, printed with no leading or trailing spaces.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5
