He wants to make a list of <i>C</i> additional pairs of cows such that, if he now compares those <i>C</i> pairs, he will definitely be able to deduce the correct ordering of all <i>N</i> cows. Please help him determine the minimum value of <i>C</i> for which such a list is possible.</p></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: Two space-separated integers: <i>N</i> and <i>M</i><br>Lines 2..<i>M</i>+1: Two space-separated integers, respectively: <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>.

However, he needs to know whether cow 1 > cow 3 to determine the cow with the second highest rank. Also, he will need one more question to determine the ordering between cow 4 and cow 5. After that, he will need to know if cow 5 > cow 3 if cow 1 has higher rank than cow 3. He will have to ask three questions in order to be sure he has the rankings: "Is cow 1 > cow 3?  Is cow 4 > cow 5? Is cow 5 > cow 3?"</div><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>USACO 2007 March Gold</a></div></td></tr></table>
