Having considered the health of those lovely cats, Facer decides to make the cats to do some exercises. Facer has well designed a set of moves for his cats. He is now asking you to supervise the cats to do his exercises. Facer's great exercise for cats contains three different moves:<br>g i : Let the ith cat take a peanut.<br>e i : Let the ith cat eat all peanuts it have.<br>s i j : Let the ith cat and jth cat exchange their peanuts.<br>All the cats perform a sequence of these moves and must repeat it m times! Poor cats! Only Facer can come up with such embarrassing idea. <br>You have to determine the final number of peanuts each cat have, and directly give them the exact quantity in order to save them. </p></div></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>The input file consists of multiple test cases, ending with three zeroes "0 0 0". For each test case, three integers <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> and <i>k</i> are given firstly, where <i>n</i> is the number of cats and <i>k</i> is the length of the move sequence. The following <i>k</i> lines describe the sequence.<br>(<i>m</i>&le;1,000,000,000, <i>n</i>&le;100, <i>k</i>&le;100)</p></div></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>For each test case, output <i>n</i> numbers in a single line, representing the numbers of peanuts the cats have. </p></div></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3 1 6
