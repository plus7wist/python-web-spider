This is a very long road, on which there are numbers of mines. At first, YYF is at step one. For each step after that, YYF will walk one step with a probability of <i>p</i>, or jump two step with a probality of 1-<i>p</i>. Here is the task, given the place of each mine, please calculate the probality that YYF can go through the "mine road" safely. </div></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div>The input contains many test cases ended with <b>EOF</b>.<br>Each test case contains two lines.<br>The First line of each test case is <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 10) and <i>p</i> (0.25 &le; <i>p</i> &le; 0.75) seperated by a single blank, standing for the number of mines and the probability to walk one step.<br>The Second line of each test case is N integer standing for the place of N mines. Each integer is in the range of [1, 100000000]. </div></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div>For each test case, output the probabilty in a single line with the precision to 7 digits after the decimal point. </div></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1 0.5
