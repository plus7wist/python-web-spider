The local American Tire store sells fiberglass patching material only in square sheets. What is the smallest patch that Harry needs to fix his door? </p><p>Assume that the holes are points on the integer lattice in the plane. Your job is to find the area of the smallest square that will cover all the holes. </p></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The first line of input contains a single integer <i>T</i> expressed in decimal with no leading zeroes, denoting the number of test cases to follow. The subsequent lines of input describe the test cases. </p><p>Each test case begins with a single line, containing a single integer <i>n</i> expressed in decimal with no leading zeroes, the number of points to follow; each of the following <i>n</i> lines contains two integers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, both expressed in decimal with no leading zeroes, giving the coordinates of one of your points. </p><p>You are guaranteed that <i>T</i> â‰¤ 30 and that no data set contains more than 30 points. All points in each data set will be no more than 500 units away from (0,0). </p></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Print, on a single line with two decimal places of precision, the area of the smallest square containing all of your points.</p></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2
