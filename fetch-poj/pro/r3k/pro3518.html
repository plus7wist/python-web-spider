For example, ‹24, 25, 26, 27, 28› between 23 and 29 is a prime gap of length 6.</p><p>Your mission is to write a program to calculate, for a given positive integer <i>k</i>, the length of the prime gap that contains <i>k</i>. For convenience, the length is considered 0 in case no prime gap contains <i>k</i>.</p></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input is a sequence of lines each of which contains a single positive integer. Each positive integer is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the 100000th prime number, which is 1299709. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing a single zero.</p></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The output should be composed of lines each of which contains a single non-negative integer. It is the length of the prime gap that contains the corresponding positive integer in the input if it is a composite number, or 0 otherwise. No other characters should occur in the output.</p></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">10
