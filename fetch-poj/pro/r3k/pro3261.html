On further investigation, he discovered that although he can't predict the quality of milk from one day to the next, there are some regular patterns in the daily milk quality.</p><p>To perform a rigorous study, he has invented a complex classification scheme by which each milk sample is recorded as an integer between 0 and 1,000,000 inclusive, and has recorded data from a single cow over <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 20,000) days. He wishes to find the longest pattern of samples which repeats identically at least K (2 &le; <i>K</i> &le; <i>N</i>) times. This may include overlapping patterns -- 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 1 repeats 2 3 2 3 twice, for example.</p><p>Help Farmer John by finding the longest repeating subsequence in the sequence of samples. It is guaranteed that at least one subsequence is repeated at least <i>K</i> times.</p></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: Two space-separated integers: <i>N</i> and <i>K</i><br>Lines 2..<i>N</i>+1: <i>N</i> integers, one per line, the quality of the milk on day <i>i</i> appears on the <i>i</i>th line.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: One integer, the length of the longest pattern which occurs at least <i>K</i> times</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">8 2
