She does not want to get to her old home too quickly, because she likes the scenery along the way. She has decided to take the second-shortest rather than the shortest path. She knows there must be some second-shortest path.</p><p>The countryside consists of <i>R</i> (1 &le; <i>R</i> &le; 100,000) bidirectional roads, each linking two of the N (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 5000) intersections, conveniently numbered 1..<i>N</i>. Bessie starts at intersection 1, and her friend (the destination) is at intersection <i>N</i>.</p><p>The second-shortest path may share roads with any of the shortest paths, and it may backtrack i.e., use the same road or intersection more than once. The second-shortest path is the shortest path whose length is longer than the shortest path(s) (i.e., if two or more shortest paths exist, the second-shortest path is the one whose length is longer than those but no longer than any other path).</p></body></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: Two space-separated integers: <i>N</i> and <i>R</i><br>Lines 2..<i>R</i>+1: Each line contains three space-separated integers: <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>D</i> that describe a road that connects intersections <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> and has length <i>D</i> (1 &le; <i>D</i> &le; 5000)</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: The length of the second shortest path between node 1 and node <i>N</i></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 4
