He is always facing challenging problems, and now he must solve a new one. He has to handle a set of servers with differing capabilities available to process job requests from persistent sources - jobs that need to be processed over a long or indefinite period of time. A sequence of persistent job requests arrives revealing a subset of servers capable of servicing their request. A job is processed on a single server and a server processes only one job. Bob has to schedule the maximum number of jobs on the servers. For example, if there are 2 jobs j1, j2 and 2 servers s1, s2, job j1 requiring the server s1, and job j2 requiring also the server s1. In this case Bob can schedule only one job. Can you help him? <br>In the general case there are n jobs numbered from 0 to n-1, n servers numbered from n to 2*n-1, and a sequence of job requests. The problem asks to find the maximum number of jobs that can be processed.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The program input is at most 1 MB. Each data set in the file stands for a particular set of jobs. A data set starts with the number n (n &lt;= 10000) of jobs, followed by the list of required servers for each job, in the format: <i>job<sub>number</sub>: (nr_servers) s<sub>1</sub> ... s<sub>nr_servers</sub></i> The program prints the maximum number of jobs that can be processed. <br>White spaces can occur freely in the input. The input data are correct and terminate with an end of file.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each set of data the program prints the result to the standard output from the beginning of a line.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2 
0: (1) 2 
1: (1) 2 
1 
0: (1) 1</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">1
1</pre><h3>Hint</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There are two data sets. In the first case, the number of jobs n is 2, numbered 0 and 1. The sequence of requests for job 0 is: 0: (1) 2, meaning that job 0 requires 1 sever, the server numbered 2. The sequence of requests for job 1 is: 1: (1) 2, meaning that job 1 requires 1 sever, the server numbered 2. The result for the data set is the length of the maximum number of scheduled jobs, 1. </div><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>Southeastern European Regional Programming Contest 2009</a></div></td></tr></table>
