To make things easier for him, you want to buy goods in such a way that the product of their prices is the same as the sum of their prices.</p><p>Of course, if you buy only one item, this is always true. With two items and three items, it still seems quite a boring task to you, so now you are interested in finding possible prices of four items such that the sum of the four prices is equal to the product of the four prices. You should consider the prices are in &euro; with two digits after the decimal point. Obviously, each product costs at least one cent.</p></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>This problem has no input.</p></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Print all solutions which have a sum of the four items of at most <strong>20.00 &euro;</strong>. For each solution, print one line with the prices of the four items in non-decreasing order, with one space character between them. You may print the solutions in any order, but make sure to print each solution only once.</p></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio"></pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">0.50 1.00 2.50 16.00
