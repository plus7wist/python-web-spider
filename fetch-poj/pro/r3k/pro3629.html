Start by dealing the card on the top of the deck to the cow to her right</p><p>2. Every time she deals a card, she must place the next <i>P</i> (1 &le; <i>P</i> &le; 10) cards on the bottom of the deck; and</p><p>3. Continue dealing in this manner to each player sequentially in a counterclockwise manner</p><p>Bessie, desperate to win, asks you to help her figure out where she should put the &quot;good&quot; cards so that she gets all of them.
