Teachers encourage pupils to play the game as it enhances their arithmetic skills, logical thinking, and following-up simple procedures. We think that, most probably, you too will master in few minutes. Here’s one example of how you too can play this game: Ask a friend to think of a number, let’s call it n<sub>0</sub>. Then:<br><ol><br><li>Ask your friend to compute n<sub>1</sub> = 3 * n<sub>0</sub> and to tell you if n<sub>1</sub> is even or odd.</li><br><li>If n<sub>1</sub> is even, ask your friend to compute n<sub>2</sub> = n<sub>1</sub>/2. If, otherwise, n<sub>1</sub> was odd then let your friend compute n<sub>2</sub> = (n<sub>1</sub> + 1)/2.</li><br><li>Now ask your friend to calculate n<sub>3</sub> = 3 * n<sub>2</sub>.</li><br><li>Ask your friend to tell tell you the result of n<sub>4</sub> = n<sub>3</sub>/9. (n<sub>4</sub> is the quotient of the division operation. In computer lingo, ’/’ is the integer-division operator.)</li><br><li>Now you can simply reveal the original number by calculating n<sub>0</sub> = 2 * n<sub>4</sub> if n<sub>1</sub> was even, or n<sub>0</sub> = 2 * n<sub>4</sub> + 1 otherwise.</li><br></ol><br>Here’s an example that you can follow: If n<sub>0</sub> = 37, then n<sub>1</sub> = 111 which is odd. Now we can calculate n<sub>2</sub> = 56, n<sub>3</sub> = 168, and n<sub>4</sub> = 18, which is what your friend will tell you. Doing the calculation 2 * n<sub>4</sub> + 1 = 37 reveals n<sub>0</sub>.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. Each test case is made of a single positive number (0 &lt; n<sub>0</sub> &lt; 1,000,000).<br>The last line of the input file has a single zero (which is not part of the test cases.)</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, print the following line:<br>k. B Q<br>Where k is the test case number (starting at one,) B is either ’even’ or ’odd’ (without the quotes) depending on your friend’s answer in step 1. Q is your friend’s answer to step 4.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">37
