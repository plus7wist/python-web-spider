You are very proud of yourself and even expect being paid bonus this month. Your boss, whose nickname is Dean, asks you to come over to his office for a moment. You expect thanks and even promotion. But …</p><p>‘What is this?’ asks Dean and shows you your latest report.</p><p>‘Well, h-m-m, these are results of my <i>FAMI</i> algorithm research, a-a-a,’ you answer. It seems that your dreams about soon promotion are … just dreams. But you still do not understand what is wrong about your report.</p><p>‘I can read, by the way,’ continues Dean. ‘I am talking about the absolute error. Why it is so big? I require better results!’</p><p>When you argue with your boss, the best argument is silence. So, now instead of bonuses and promotions you need to rewrite your program.</p><p>Developers wish the map generator produced <i>connected </i>maps. A map is said to be <i>connected </i>when between any pair of planets there is a path, consisting of one or more hyperspace tunnels. Unfortunately, it appears that maps generated by <i>FAMI</i> algorithm sometimes are not <i>connected</i>. You are assigned to research this phenomenon.</p><p>You need to write a program which being given numbers <b>N</b> and <b>P</b> calculates probability of generating <i>connected</i> map by <i>FAMI</i> algorithm.</p></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input, as in the previous task, consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer number <b>N</b> (1 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 20), while the second line contains a real number <b>P</b> (0 ≤ <b>P</b> ≤ 1).</p></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The output needs to contain an answer - the single real number which is the probability of generating <i>connected </i>map by <i>FAMI </i>algorithm. Absolute error of the answer must not exceed <b>10<sup>−8</sup></b>.</p></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3
