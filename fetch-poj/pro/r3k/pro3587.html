The twins are fiercely competitive, and on their birthday they always vie with each other for the biggest portion of the cake. The wise king and queen have devised the following way to prevent squabbles over the cake. The King randomly selects some points in the same plane, and then the prince will be given the chance to select three different points from them to make a triangle. The circumcircle of the triangle would be the shape of the cake for him. Now one of the little princes asks you for help.
