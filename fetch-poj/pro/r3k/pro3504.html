For example, the sentence &ldquo;tihs snetncee mkaes prfecet sesne&rdquo;, makes perfect sense to most people.</p><p>If you remove all spaces from a sentence, it still remains perfectly readable, see for example: &ldquo;thissentencemakesperfectsense&rdquo;, however if you combine these two things, first shuffling, then removing spaces, things get hard. The following sentence is harder to decipher: &ldquo;tihssnetnceemkaesprfecetsesne&rdquo;.</p><p>You&rsquo;re given a sentence in the last form, together with a dictionary of valid words and are asked to decipher the text.</p></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100.
