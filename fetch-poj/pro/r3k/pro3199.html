Among the titles you can find very rare albums of Hard Rock, Classical Music, Reggae and much more; each title is considered to be unique. Last week he was listening to one of his favorite songs, <i>Nobody&rsquo;s fool</i>, and realized that it would be prudent to be aware of the many ways he can give away the CDs among some of his nephews.</p><p>So far he has not made up his mind about the total amount of CDs and the number of nephews. Indeed, a given nephew may receive no CDs at all.</p><p>Please help dear Uncle Jack, given the total number of CDs and the number of nephews, to calculate the number of different ways to distribute the CDs among the nephews.</p></span></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input consists of several test cases.
