Being finicky beasts, they demand that the corral be square and that the corral contain at least C (1 <= C <= 500) clover fields for afternoon treats. The corral's edges must be parallel to the X,Y axes. <br><br>FJ's land contains a total of N (C <= N <= 500) clover fields, each a block of size 1 x 1 and located at with its lower left corner at integer X and Y coordinates each in the range 1..10,000. Sometimes more than one clover field grows at the same location; such a field would have its location appear twice (or more) in the input. A corral surrounds a clover field if the field is entirely located inside the corral's borders.<br><br>Help FJ by telling him the side length of the smallest square containing C clover fields.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: Two space-separated integers: C and N<br><br>Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers that are the X,Y coordinates of a clover field.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: A single line with a single integer that is length of one edge of the minimum size square that contains at least C clover fields.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3 4
