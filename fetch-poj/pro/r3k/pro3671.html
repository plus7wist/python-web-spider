They have organized themselves into two groups (conveniently numbered 1 and 2) that insist upon dining together in order, with group 1 at the beginning of the line and group 2 at the end. The trouble starts when they line up at the barn to enter the feeding area.</p><p>Each cow <i>i</i> carries with her a small card upon which is engraved <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> (1 ≤ <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> ≤ 2) indicating her dining group membership. The entire set of<i> N</i> (1 ≤ <i>N</i> ≤ 30,000) cows has lined up for dinner but it&#39;s easy for anyone to see that they are not grouped by their dinner-partner cards.</p><p>FJ&#39;s job is not so difficult. He just walks down the line of cows changing their dinner partner assignment by marking out the old number and writing in a new one. By doing so, he creates groups of cows like 112222 or 111122 where the cows&#39; dining groups are sorted in ascending order by their dinner cards. Rarely he might change cards so that only one group of cows is left (e.g., 1111 or 222).</p><p>FJ is just as lazy as the next fellow. He&#39;s curious: what is the absolute minimum number of cards he must change to create a proper grouping of dining partners? He must only change card numbers and must not rearrange the cows standing in line.</p></div></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: A single integer: <i>N</i><br>* Lines 2..<i>N</i>+1: Line <i>i</i>+1 describes cow<i> i</i>&#39;s dining preference with a single integer: <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> </p></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: A single integer that is the minimum number of cards Farmer John must change to assign the cows to eating groups as described.</p></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">7
