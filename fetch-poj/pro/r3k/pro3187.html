They write down the numbers from 1 to N (1 <= N <= 10) in a certain order and then sum adjacent numbers to produce a new list with one fewer number.  They repeat this until only a single number is left.  For example, one instance of the game (when N=4) might go like this:<br><br><pre>    3   1   2   4<br>      4   3   6<br>        7   9<br>         16</pre>Behind FJ's back, the cows have started playing a more difficult game, in which they try to determine the starting sequence from only the final total and the number N.  Unfortunately, the game is a bit above FJ's mental arithmetic capabilities.<br><br>Write a program to help FJ play the game and keep up with the cows.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and the final sum.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: An ordering of the integers 1..N that leads to the given sum.  If there are multiple solutions, choose the one that is lexicographically least, i.e., that puts smaller numbers first.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 16</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">3 1 2 4</pre><h3>Hint</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Explanation of the sample:<br><br>There are other possible sequences, such as 3 2 1 4, but 3 1 2 4 is the lexicographically smallest.</div><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>USACO 2006 February Gold & Silver</a></div></td></tr></table>
