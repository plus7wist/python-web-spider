Visitors type in a guess between 1 and 99 and then click on a "Submit" button. Unfortunately, the response time from the server is often long, and visitors get impatient and click "Submit" several times in a row. This generates many duplicate requests.<br>Your task is to write a program to assist the staff at ACM in filtering out these duplicate requests.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of a series of lines, one for each web session. The first integer on a line is N, 0 < N â‰¤ 25, which is the number of guesses on this line. These guesses are all between 1 and 99, inclusive. The value N = 0 indicates the end of all the input.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each input data set, output a single line with the guesses in the original order, but with consecutive duplicates removed. Conclude each output line with the dollar sign character '$'. Note that there is a single space between the last integer and the dollar sign.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5 1 22 22 22 3
