They now require their barn to be immaculate. Farmer John, the most obliging of farmers, has no choice but hire some of the cows to clean the barn.<br><br>Farmer John has N (1 <= N <= 10,000) cows who are willing to do some cleaning. Because dust falls continuously, the cows require that the farm be continuously cleaned during the workday, which runs from second number M to second number E during the day (0 <= M <= E <= 86,399). Note that the total number of seconds during which cleaning is to take place is E-M+1. During any given second M..E, at least one cow must be cleaning.<br><br>Each cow has submitted a job application indicating her willingness to work during a certain interval T1..T2 (where M <= T1 <= T2 <= E) for a certain salary of S (where 0 <= S <= 500,000). Note that a cow who indicated the interval 10..20 would work for 11 seconds, not 10. Farmer John must either accept or reject each individual application; he may NOT ask a cow to work only a fraction of the time it indicated and receive a corresponding fraction of the salary.<br><br>Find a schedule in which every second of the workday is covered by at least one cow and which minimizes the total salary that goes to the cows.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, M, and E.<br><br>Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes cow i's schedule with three space-separated integers: T1, T2, and S.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: a single integer that is either the minimum total salary to get the barn cleaned or else -1 if it is impossible to clean the barn.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3 0 4

The first cow is willing to work during seconds 0, 1, and 2 for a total salary of 3, etc.<br><br>Farmer John can hire the first two cows.</div><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>USACO 2005 December Silver</a></div></td></tr></table>
