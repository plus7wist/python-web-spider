Given a string of at most 1000000 characters find and print the length of the largest palindrome inside this string.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Your program will be tested on at most 30 test cases, each test case is given as a string of at most 1000000 lowercase characters on a line by itself. The input is terminated by a line that starts with the string "END" (quotes for clarity).<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case in the input print the test case number and the length of the largest palindrome.<br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">abcbabcbabcba
abacacbaaaab
END</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">Case 1: 13
Case 2: 6</pre><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>Seventh ACM Egyptian National Programming Contest</a></div></td></tr></table>
