These barns do not overlap although they may share corners and/or sides with other barns.<br><br>Since he has extra cows to milk this year, FJ would like to expand some of his barns.  A barn has room to expand if it does not share a corner or a wall with any other barn.  That is, FJ can expand a barn if all four of its walls can be pushed outward by at least some amount without bumping into another barn.  If two barns meet at a corner, neither barn can expand.<br><br>Please determine how many barns have room to expand.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: A single integer, N<br><br>Lines 2..N+1: Four space-separated integers A, B, C, and D, describing one barn. The lower-left corner of the barn is at (A,B) and the upper right corner is at (C,D).</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: A single integer that is the number of barns that can be expanded.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5

The first barn has its lower-left corner at (0,2) and its upper-right corner at (2,7), and so on.<br><br>Only two barns can be expanded --- the first two listed in the input. All other barns are each in contact with at least one other barn.</div><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>USACO 2005 December Gold</a></div></td></tr></table>
