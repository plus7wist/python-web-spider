The bowls can be either right-side-up (properly oriented to serve refreshing cool water) or upside-down (a position which holds no water). They want all 20 water bowls to be right-side-up and thus use their wide snouts to flip bowls.<br><br>Their snouts, though, are so wide that they flip not only one bowl but also the bowls on either side of that bowl (a total of three or -- in the case of either end bowl -- two bowls).<br><br>Given the initial state of the bowls (1=undrinkable, 0=drinkable -- it even looks like a bowl), what is the minimum number of bowl flips necessary to turn all the bowls right-side-up?</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: A single line with 20 space-separated integers</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: The minimum number of bowl flips necessary to flip all the bowls right-side-up (i.e., to 0).
