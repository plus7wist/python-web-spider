There are four bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). A 6-base DNA sequence could be represented as TAGACC. <br><br>Given a set of DNA base sequences, determine the longest series of bases that occurs in all of the sequences. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer n indicating the number of datasets. Each dataset consists of the following components: <ul><li>A single positive integer m (2 <= m <= 10) indicating the number of base sequences in this dataset. <li>m lines each containing a single base sequence consisting of 60 bases. </ul></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each dataset in the input, output the longest base subsequence common to all of the given base sequences. If the longest common subsequence is less than three bases in length, display the string "no significant commonalities" instead. If multiple subsequences of the same longest length exist, output only the subsequence that comes first in alphabetical order. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3
