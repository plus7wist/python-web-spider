Here, we do only a bit of that. </p><p>An <b>H</b>-number is a positive number which is one more than a multiple of four: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21,... are the <b>H</b>-numbers. For this problem we pretend that these are the <em>only</em> numbers. The <b>H</b>-numbers are closed under multiplication. </p><p>As with regular integers, we partition the <b>H</b>-numbers into units, <b>H</b>-primes, and <b>H</b>-composites. 1 is the only unit. An <b>H</b>-number <i>h</i> is <b>H</b>-prime if it is not the unit, and is the product of two <b>H</b>-numbers in only one way: 1 &times; <i>h</i>. The rest of the numbers are <b>H</b>-composite. </p><p>For examples, the first few <b>H</b>-composites are: 5 &times; 5 = 25, 5 &times; 9 = 45, 5 &times; 13 = 65, 9 &times; 9 = 81, 5 &times; 17 = 85. </p><p>Your task is to count the number of <b>H</b>-semi-primes. An <b>H</b>-semi-prime is an <b>H</b>-number which is the product of exactly two <b>H</b>-primes. The two <b>H</b>-primes may be equal or different. In the example above, all five numbers are <b>H</b>-semi-primes. 125 = 5 &times; 5 &times; 5 is not an <b>H</b>-semi-prime, because it's the product of three <b>H</b>-primes. </p></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Each line of input contains an <b>H</b>-number &le; 1,000,001.
