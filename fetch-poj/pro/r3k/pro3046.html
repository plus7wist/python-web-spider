She realized that many of the ants were siblings, indistinguishable from one another.  She also realized the sometimes only one ant would go for food, sometimes a few, and sometimes all of them. This made for a large number of different sets of ants!<br><br>Being a bit mathematical, Bessie started wondering.  Bessie noted that the hive has T (1 <= T <= 1,000) families of ants which she labeled 1..T (A ants altogether).  Each family had some number Ni (1 <=  Ni <= 100) of ants.<br><br>How many groups of sizes S, S+1, ..., B (1 <= S <= B <= A) can be formed?<br><br>While observing one group, the set of three ant families was seen as {1, 1, 2, 2, 3}, though rarely in that order. The possible sets of marching ants were:<br><br>  3 sets with 1 ant:  {1} {2} {3}<br>  5 sets with 2 ants: {1,1} {1,2} {1,3} {2,2} {2,3}<br>  5 sets with 3 ants: {1,1,2} {1,1,3} {1,2,2} {1,2,3} {2,2,3}<br>  3 sets with 4 ants: {1,2,2,3} {1,1,2,2} {1,1,2,3}<br>  1 set  with 5 ants: {1,1,2,2,3}<br><br>Your job is to count the number of possible sets of ants given the data above.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: 4 space-separated integers: T, A, S, and B<br><br>* Lines 2..A+1: Each line contains a single integer that is an ant type present in the hive</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: The number of sets of size S..B (inclusive) that can be created. A set like {1,2} is the same as the set {2,1} and should not be double-counted.
