Po was surprising at the situation; Tai Lung and Master Shifu were also surprising since no body believes that the mystic dragon scroll is just a blank paper. After Tai Lung was defeated, Po found Master Wugui’s Diary and know that the dragon scroll recorded some messages long long years ago, but these messages were blurred due to abrasions. Master Wugui has copied these blurred messages and he wants someone to recover these messages. The messages has a specific length, and each position could be digit, &#39;?&#39; or &#39;,&#39;. It is known that each message recorded some strictly increasing positive integers (without leading zeroes) separated by commas and Po is asked to recover these numbers. </div></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div>There are multiple test cases.
