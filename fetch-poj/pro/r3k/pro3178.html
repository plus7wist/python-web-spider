Today, FJ wants to construct a giant "field web". FJ's field is large convex polygon with fences along the boundary and fence posts at each of the N corners (1 <= N <= 150). To construct his field web, FJ wants to run as many ropes as possible in straight lines between pairs of non-adjacent fence posts such that no two ropes cross.<br><br>There is one complication: FJ's field is not completely usable. Some evil aliens have created a total of G (0 <= G <= 100) grain circles in the field, all of radius R (1 <= R <= 100,000). FJ is afraid to upset the aliens, and therefore doesn't want the ropes to pass through, or even touch the very edge of a grain circle. Note that although the centers of all the circles are contained within the field, a wide radius may make it extend outside of the field, and both fences and fence posts may be within a grain circle.<br><br>Given the locations of the fence posts and the centers of the circles, determine the maximum number of ropes that FJ can use to create his field web.<br><br>FJ's fence pots and the circle centers all have integer coordinates X and Y each of which is in the range 0..1,000,000.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, G, and R<br><br>Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers that are the X,Y position of a fence post on the boundary of FJ's field.<br><br>Lines N+2..N+G+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers that are the X,Y position of a circle's center inside FJ's field.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: A single integer that is the largest number of ropes FJ can use for his artistic creation.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5 3 1
