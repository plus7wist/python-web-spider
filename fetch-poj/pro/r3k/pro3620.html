His insurance agency will only repay him, however, an amount depending on the size of the largest &quot;lake&quot; on his farm.<br><br>The farm is represented as a rectangular grid with <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) rows and <i>M</i> (1 &le; <i>M</i> &le; 100) columns. Each cell in the grid is either dry or submerged, and exactly <i>K</i> (1 &le; <i>K</i> &le; <i>N</i> &times; <i>M</i>) of the cells are submerged. As one would expect, a lake has a central cell to which other cells connect by sharing a long edge (not a corner). Any cell that shares a long edge with the central cell or shares a long edge with any connected cell becomes a connected cell and is part of the lake.</p></div></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: <i>N</i>, <i>M</i>, and <i>K</i><br>* Lines 2..<i>K</i>+1: Line <i>i</i>+1 describes one submerged location with two space separated integers that are its row and column: <i>R</i> and <i>C</i></p></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: The number of cells that the largest lake contains.ã€€</p></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3 4 5
