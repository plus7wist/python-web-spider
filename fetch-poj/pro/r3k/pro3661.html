When she chooses to run in minute <i>i</i>, she will run exactly a distance of <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> (1 &le; <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> &le; 1,000) and her exhaustion factor will increase by 1 -- but must never be allowed to exceed <i>M</i> (1 &le; <i>M</i> &le; 500). If she chooses to rest, her exhaustion factor will decrease by 1 for each minute she rests. She cannot commence running again until her exhaustion factor reaches 0. At that point, she can choose to run or rest.</p><p>At the end of the <i>N</i> minute workout, Bessie's exaustion factor must be exactly 0, or she will not have enough energy left for the rest of the day.</p><p>Find the maximal distance Bessie can run.</p></div></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: <i>N</i> and <i>M</i><br>* Lines 2..<i>N</i>+1: Line <i>i</i>+1 contains the single integer: <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> </p></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: A single integer representing the largest distance Bessie can run while satisfying the conditions.<br>ã€€</p></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5 2
