The labels must be positioned such that non-intersecting line segments connect each vertex to each of its subtrees. That is to say, we draw the normal planar representation of the tree, preserving the order of subtrees. Beyond these constraints, the position, shape, and size of the representation is arbitrary. <br><br>For example, a possible graphical representation for A(B(C,D),E) is <img src=images/1867_1.jpg><br>Given the textual representation for two trees, you are to determine whether or not they are equivalent. That is, do they share a common paper representation? </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of input contains t, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines, each specifying a tree in the notation described above. Each line will contain at most 200 characters, and no white space.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output a line containing "same" or "different" as appropriate. <br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2
A(B(C,D),E)
E(A,B(C,D))
A(B(C,D),E)
E(A(B(C,D)))
