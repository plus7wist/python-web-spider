Removing vowels and letters that appear twice or more from MISSISSIPPI yields MSP.  In a krunched word, a letter appears only once, the first time it would appear in the unkrunched word.  Vowels never appear.<br><br>Krunched phrases similarly have no vowels and no repeated letters. Consider this phrase:<br><pre>        RAILROAD CROSSING</pre><br>and its krunched version:<br><pre>        RLD CSNG</pre><br>Blanks are krunched differently. Blanks are removed so that a krunched phrase has no blanks on its beginning or end, never has two blanks in a row, and has no blanks before punctuation.  Otherwise, blanks not removed. If we represent blanks by "_",<br><pre>        MADAM_I_SAY_I_AM_ADAM__</pre><br>krunches to:<br><pre>        MD_SY</pre><br>where the single remaining blank is shown by "_".<br><br>Write a program that reads a line of input (whose length ranges from 2 to 70 characters), and krunches it.  Put the krunched word or phrase in the output file.  The input line has only capital letters, blanks, and the standard punctuation marks: period, comma, and question mark.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A single line to be krunched.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A single krunched line that follows the rules above.<br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR COUNTRY.
