Each pentagon adjoins 5 hexagons and each hexagon adjoins 3 pentagons and 3 hexagons. Eric drew a polygon (i.e. a closed line without intersections) along the edges of the pieces. The polygon divided the ball into two parts and Eric painted one of them green. <br><center><img src=images/1766_1.jpg></center><br>He is curious if given a description of the polygon you are able to compute the number of black, white and green pieces? <br><br>Task<br>Write a program that:<br><br>reads the description of a polygon, <br>computes the number of black, white and green pieces, <br>writes the result. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input contains one integer n being the number of vertices of the polygon. The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2,..., an separated by single spaces. Integer ai (equal 1 or 2) is the number of green pieces adjoining the i-th vertex of the polygon. The side of the polygon connecting the n-th and the first vertex always lies between two hexagons. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first and only line of the output contains three integers b, w and g - the numbers of black, white and green pieces respectively. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">21
