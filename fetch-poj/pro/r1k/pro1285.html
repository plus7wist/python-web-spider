Each test case begins with two integers n (0 < n <= 50), m (0 <= m <= n). The next line will contain the labels (numbers in the range 1 to n) of the n objects you are to choose from.  Two objects with the same label are considered equivalent. Then in the last line for that test case, you'd have m values for r. There will be a single space separating two consecutive numbers in a line. Input is terminated by a test case where n=0, you must not process this test case.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, print the test case number. And for each query number r, print the number of different groups that can be formed if r objects are taken from the given n objects. You can assume that for all input cases, the output will always fit in a 64-bit unsigned integer and (0<=r<=n).</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5 2
