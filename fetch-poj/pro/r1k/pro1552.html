You will need a program to help you with the grading. This program should be able to scan the lists and output the correct answer for each one. For example, given the list <br><center><pre>1 4 3 2 9 7 18 22</pre></center><br>your program should answer 3, as 2 is twice 1, 4 is twice 2, and 18 is twice 9. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input will consist of one or more lists of numbers. There will be one list of numbers per line. Each list will contain from 2 to 15 unique positive integers. No integer will be larger than 99. Each line will be terminated with the integer 0, which is not considered part of the list. A line with the single number -1 will mark the end of the file. The example input below shows 3 separate lists. Some lists may not contain any doubles.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output will consist of one line per input list, containing a count of the items that are double some other item. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1 4 3 2 9 7 18 22 0
