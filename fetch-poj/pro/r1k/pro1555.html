<div class="plm"><table align="center"><tr><td><b>Time Limit:</b> 1000MS</td><td width="10px"></td><td><b>Memory Limit:</b> 10000K</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Submissions:</b> 5005</td><td width="10px"></td><td><b>Accepted:</b> 1676</td></table></div><h3>Description</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Given the coefficients of a polynomial from degree 8 down to 0, you are to format the polynomial in a readable format with unnecessary characters removed. For instance, given the coefficients 0, 0, 0, 1, 22, -333, 0, 1, and -1, you should generate an output line which displays x^5 + 22x^4 - 333x^3 + x - 1. <br>The formatting rules which must be adhered to are as follows:<br><br>1. Terms must appear in decreasing order of degree.<br><br>2. Exponents should appear after a caret `"^".<br><br>3. The constant term appears as only the constant.<br><br>4. Only terms with nonzero coefficients should appear, unless all terms have zero coefficients in which case the constant term should appear.<br><br>5. The only spaces should be a single space on either side of the binary + and - operators.<br><br>6. If the leading term is positive then no sign should precede it; a negative leading term should be preceded by a minus sign, as in -7x^2 + 30x + 66.<br><br>7. Negated terms should appear as a subtracted unnegated term (with the exception of a negative leading term which should appear as described above). That is, rather than x^2 + -3x, the output should be x^2 - 3x.<br><br>8. The constants 1 and -1 should appear only as the constant term. That is, rather than -1x^3 + 1x^2 + 3x^1 - 1, the output should appear as-x^3 + x^2 + 3x - 1.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input will contain one or more lines of coefficients delimited by one or more spaces. There are nine coefficients per line, each coefficient being an integer with a magnitude of less than 1000. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output should contain the formatted polynomials, one per line.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">0 0 0 1 22 -333 0 1 -1
