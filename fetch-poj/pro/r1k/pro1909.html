Each box is either empty or contains a number of marbles; the total number of marbles is n. <br>The task is to move the marbles such that each box contains exactly one marble. This is to be accomplished be a sequence of moves; each move consists of moving one marble to a box at an adjacent vertex. What is the minimum number of moves required to achieve the goal? <br><br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains a number of cases. Each case starts with the number n followed by n lines. Each line contains at least three numbers which are: v the number of a vertex, followed by the number of marbles originally placed at vertex v followed by a number d which is the number of children of v, followed by d numbers giving the identities of the children of v. <br>The input is terminated by a case where n = 0 and this case should not be processed. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each case in the input, output the smallest number of moves of marbles resulting in one marble at each vertex of the tree. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">9
