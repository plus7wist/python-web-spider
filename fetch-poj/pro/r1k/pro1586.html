Unfortunately, sorting these has become a problem. The manager has given you the task of organizing them. You have decided to classify them by edge length and angles. To measure each triangle, you set it on a large sheet of very accurate graph paper and record the coordinate of each point. You then run these three points through a computer program to classify the triangles according to:<br><b>Scalene</b> no equal sides<br><b>Isosceles</b> two equal sides<br><b>Equilateral</b> three equal sides<br>and<br><b>Acute</b> all angles under 90<br><b>Right</b> one angle equal 90<br><b>Obtuse</b> one angle over 90<br>Of course, sometimes you make mistakes entering the data, so if you input points that do not form a valid triangle, your program should tell you.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">One triangle is described per line. Each line has six measurements taken to the nearest 0.001 in the order:<br>x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3<br>The final line of input will contain only a -1.<br>None of the test sets contain non-right angles in the range 88-92 degrees, nor do any of the test sets include any non-equal side lengths for one triangle within 0.01 of one another.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">You will output one line for each triangle, which will contain two words:<br>< length classification > < angle classification ><br>or<br>Not a Triangle<br>The final line of your output file will be:<br>End of Output</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">10.000 10.000 10.000 20.000 20.000 10.000
