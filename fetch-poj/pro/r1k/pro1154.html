There is a single uppercase letter (A-Z) written in every position in the board.<br>Before the begging of the game there is a figure in the upper-left corner of the board (first row, first column). In every move, a player can move the figure to the one of the adjacent positions (up, down,left or right). Only constraint is that a figure cannot visit a position marked with the same letter twice.<br>The goal of the game is to play as many moves as possible.<br>Write a program that will calculate the maximal number of positions in the board the figure can visit in a single game.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input contains two integers R and C, separated by a single blank character, 1 <= R, S <= 20.<br>The following R lines contain S characters each. Each line represents one row in the board.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first and only line of the output should contain the maximal number of position in the board the figure can visit.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3 6
