Each table has four legs, each of which uses a different type of coin. For example, one leg might be a stack of quarters, another nickels, another loonies, and another twonies. Each leg must be exactly the same length. <br>Many coins are available for these tables, including foreign and special commemorative coins. Given an inventory of available coins and a desired table height, compute the lengths nearest to the desired height for which four legs of equal length may be constructed using a different coin for each leg. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input consists of several test cases. Each case begins with two integers: 4 <= n <= 50 giving the number of types of coins available, and 1 <= t <= 10 giving the number of tables to be designed. n lines follow; each gives the thickness of a coin in hundredths of millimetres. t lines follow; each gives the height of a table to be designed (also in hundredths of millimetres). A line containing 0 0 follows the last test case. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each table, output a line with two integers: the greatest leg length not exceeding the desired length, and the smallest leg length not less than the desired length. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 2
