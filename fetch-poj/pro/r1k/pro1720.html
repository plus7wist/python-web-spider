All the corners have integer coordinates and the squares do not touch or overlap.<br>You are required to count the number of squares visible from the origin point O, O = (0, 0).<br>A square is visible from the origin point O if there are two distinct points A and B on one of its sides such that the interior of the triangle OAB has no common points with any of the remaining squares.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input contains the integer N, 1 <= N <= 1000, the number of squares.<br>Each of the following N lines describes a square by specifying integers X, Y and L separated by single blank characters, 1 <= X, Y, L <= 10000. X and Y are coordinates of the lower left corner (the corner with the least X and Y coordinates) and L is the side length.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first and the only line of the output should contain the number of squares that are visible from the origin.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3
