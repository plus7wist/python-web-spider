The three points will not be on a straight line. <br>The solution is to be printed as an equation of the form <br><pre>	(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2				(1)</pre><br>and an equation of the form <br><pre>	x^2 + y^2 + cx + dy - e = 0				(2)</pre><br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each line of input to your program will contain the x and y coordinates of three points, in the order Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy. These coordinates will be real numbers separated from each other by one or more spaces.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Your program must print the required equations on two lines using the format given in the sample below. Your computed values for h, k, r, c, d, and e in Equations 1 and 2 above are to be printed with three digits after the decimal point. Plus and minus signs in the equations should be changed as needed to avoid multiple signs before a number. Plus, minus, and equal signs must be separated from the adjacent characters by a single space on each side. No other spaces are to appear in the equations. Print a single blank line after each equation pair.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">7.0 -5.0 -1.0 1.0 0.0 -6.0
1.0 7.0 8.0 6.0 7.0 -2.0
</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">(x - 3.000)^2 + (y + 2.000)^2 = 5.000^2
x^2 + y^2 - 6.000x + 4.000y - 12.000 = 0

(x - 3.921)^2 + (y - 2.447)^2 = 5.409^2
x^2 + y^2 - 7.842x - 4.895y - 7.895 = 0
