The marathon route will include a pair of farms and a path comprised of a sequence of roads between them. Since FJ wants the cows to get as much exercise as possible he wants to find the two farms on his map that are the farthest apart from each other (distance being measured in terms of total length of road on the path between the two farms).  Help him determine the distances between this farthest pair of farms.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Lines 1.....: Same input format as "Navigation Nightmare".</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: An integer giving the distance between the farthest pair of farms.<br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">7 6
