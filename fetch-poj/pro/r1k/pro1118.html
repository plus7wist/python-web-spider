She had to drop packages at specific points scattered in a dangerous area. Furthermore, the pilot could only fly over the area once in a straight line, and she had to fly over as many points as possible. All points were given by means of integer coordinates in a two-dimensional space. The pilot wanted to know the largest number of points from the given set that all lie on one line. Can you write a program that calculates this number? <br><br><br>Your program has to be efficient! <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input consist several case,First line of the each case is an integer N ( 1 < N < 700 ),then follow N pairs of integers. Each pair of integers is separated by one blank and ended by a new-line character. The input ended by N=0.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">output one integer for each input case ,representing the largest number of points that all lie on one line. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">5
