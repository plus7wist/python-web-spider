Two people, called A and B, each flip two quarters each round. They each gain or lose points each round based on the following tables:<br><center><img src=images/1217_1.jpg></center><br>There is no difference between Heads/Tails and Tails/Heads. As you can see, the odds are stacked in Player A's favor. At the beginning of the game, each player has 0 points, and points accumulate as the game progresses. At the<br>end of the game, whichever player has the most points wins.<br>You must write a program that determines the probability that Player A will win, Player B will win, or they will tie, after a certain number of rounds. Assume that the coins are fair, i.e. that heads and tails are equally likely.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There is no input file for this problem.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output a table that lists the probability that Player A will win, B will win, or they will tie, after each round for 1 to 20 rounds.
