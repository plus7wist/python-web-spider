As the figure indicates, the three Exomedians intersect at a common point called the Exocenter (point O in the figure).<br>This problem is to write a program to compute the Exocenters of triangles.<br><img src=images/1673_1.jpg></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input consists of a positive integer n, which is the number of datasets that follow. Each dataset consists of 3 lines; each line contains two floating point values which represent the (two -dimensional) coordinate of one vertex of a triangle. So, there are total of (n*3) + 1 lines of input. Note: All input triangles wi ll be strongly non-degenerate in that no vertex will be within one unit of the line through the other two vertices.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each dataset you must print out the coordinates of the Exocenter of the input triangle correct to four decimal places.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2
