It has its tail in its mouth and continously devours itself.<br><br>The Ouroboros numbers are binary numbers of 2^n bits that have the property of "generating" the whole set of numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1. The generation works as follows: given an Ouroboros number, we place its 2^n bits wrapped in a circle. Then, we can take 2^n groups of n bits starting each time with the next bit in the circle. Such circles are called Ouroboros circles for the number n. We will work only with the smallest<br>Ouroboros number for each n.<br><br>Example: for n = 2, there are only four Ouroboros numbers. These are 0011;0110;1100; and 1001. In this case, the smallest one is 0011. Here is the Ouroboros circle for 0011:<br><center><img src=images/1392_1.jpg></center><br>The table describes the function o(n;k) which calculates the k-th number in the Ouroboros circle of the smallest Ouroboros number of size n. This function is what your program should compute.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of several test cases. For each test case, there will be a line containing two integers n and k (1<=n<=15; 0<=k<2^n). The end of the input file is indicated by a line containing two zeros. DonæŠ° process that line.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output o(n;k) on a line by itself.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2 0
