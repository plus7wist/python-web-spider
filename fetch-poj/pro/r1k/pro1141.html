Empty sequence is a regular sequence.<br>2. If S is a regular sequence, then (S) and [S] are both regular sequences.<br>3. If A and B are regular sequences, then AB is a regular sequence.<br><br>For example, all of the following sequences of characters are regular brackets sequences:<br><br>(), [], (()), ([]), ()[], ()[()]<br><br>And all of the following character sequences are not:<br><br>(, [, ), )(, ([)], ([(]<br><br>Some sequence of characters '(', ')', '[', and ']' is given. You are to find the shortest possible regular brackets sequence, that contains the given character sequence as a subsequence. Here, a string a1 a2 ... an is called a subsequence of the string b1 b2 ... bm, if there exist such indices 1 = i1 < i2 < ... < in = m, that aj = bij for all 1 = j = n.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input file contains at most 100 brackets (characters '(', ')', '[' and ']') that are situated on a single line without any other characters among them.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Write to the output file a single line that contains some regular brackets sequence that has the minimal possible length and contains the given sequence as a subsequence.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">([(]</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">()[()]</pre><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>Northeastern Europe 2001</a></div></td></tr></table>
