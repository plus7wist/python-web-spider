For some of them efficient algorithms are already available, these are the "easy" problems like sorting, evaluating a polynomial or finding the shortest path in a graph. For the "hard" ones only exponential-time algorithms are known. The traveling-salesman problem belongs to this latter group. Given a set of N towns and roads between these towns, the problem is to compute the shortest path allowing a salesman to visit each of the towns once and only once and return to the starting point.<br><br>Problem<br><br>The president of Gridland has hired you to design a program that calculates the length of the shortest traveling-salesman tour for the towns in the country. In Gridland, there is one town at each of the points of a rectangular grid. Roads run from every town in the directions North, Northwest, West, Southwest, South, Southeast, East, and Northeast, provided that there is a neighbouring town in that direction. The distance between neighbouring towns in directions North-South or East-West is 1 unit. The length of the roads is measured by the Euclidean distance. For example, Figure 7 shows 2 * 3-Gridland, i.e., a rectangular grid of dimensions 2 by 3. In 2 * 3-Gridland, the shortest tour has length 6. <br><center><img src=images/1450_1.jpg><br>Figure 7: A traveling-salesman tour in 2 ? 3-Gridland.</center><br><br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line contains the number of scenarios.<br><br>For each scenario, the grid dimensions m and n will be given as two integer numbers in a single line, separated by a single blank, satisfying 1 < m < 50 and 1 < n < 50.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output for each scenario begins with a line containing "Scenario #i:", where i is the number of the scenario starting at 1.
