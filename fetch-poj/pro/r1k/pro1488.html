It takes source text together with a few typesetting instructions and produces, one hopes, a beautiful document. Beautiful documents use double-left-quote and double-right-quote to delimit quotations, rather than the mundane " which is what is provided by most keyboards. Keyboards typically do not have an oriented double-quote, but they do have a left-single-quote ` and a right-single-quote '. Check your keyboard now to locate the left-single-quote key ` (sometimes called the "backquote key") and the right-single-quote key ' (sometimes called the "apostrophe" or just "quote"). Be careful not to confuse the left-single-quote ` with the "backslash" key \. TEX lets the user type two left-single-quotes `` to create a left-double-quote and two right-single-quotes '' to create a right-double-quote. Most typists, however, are accustomed to delimiting their quotations with the un-oriented double-quote ". <br><br>If the source contained <br>"To be or not to be," quoth the bard, "that is the question."<br>then the typeset document produced by TEX would not contain the desired form: "To be or not to be," quoth the bard, "that is the question." In order to produce the desired form, the source file must contain the sequence: <br>``To be or not to be,'' quoth the bard, ``that is the question.''<br>You are to write a program which converts text containing double-quote (") characters into text that is identical except that double-quotes have been replaced by the two-character sequences required by TEX for delimiting quotations with oriented double-quotes. The double-quote (") characters should be replaced appropriately by either `` if the " opens a quotation and by '' if the " closes a quotation. Notice that the question of nested quotations does not arise: The first " must be replaced by ``, the next by '', the next by ``, the next by '', the next by ``, the next by '', and so on. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input will consist of several lines of text containing an even number of double-quote (") characters.
