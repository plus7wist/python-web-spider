He therefore wants to find a path of a more reasonable length.  The input to this problem consists of the same input as in "Navigation Nightmare",followed by a line containing a single integer K, followed by K "distance queries".  Each distance query is a line of input containing two integers, giving the numbers of two farms between which FJ is interested in computing distance (measured in the length of the roads along the path between the two farms).  Please answer FJ's distance queries as quickly as possible!<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Lines 1..1+M: Same format as "Navigation Nightmare"<br><br>* Line 2+M: A single integer, K.  1 <= K <= 10,000<br><br>* Lines 3+M..2+M+K: Each line corresponds to a distance query and  contains the indices of two farms.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Lines 1..K: For each distance query, output on a single line an integer giving  the appropriate distance.<br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">7 6
