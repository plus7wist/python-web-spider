It is our duty to classify them all and we count on your assistance. The plans of the labyrinths are already digitized and we need you to write a program to decide if the central courtyard of a given labyrinth can be reached following the simple procedure of always turning left at any intersection, and thus be called a left labyrinth. <br><br>The digitalization process reduces the plan of a labyrinth to a grid of cells, being each cell either a block of wall or just floor. Walls are sequences of contiguous blocks, forming either horizontal or vertical corridors between them. Each labyrinth has a single entrance, a hole in its exterior walls, and a single central courtyard. The courtyard differs from the corridors in the shape: a floor cell in a corridor has at least 2 block of wall on each side. You can assume that each plan has a single labyrinth and its outside walls can be contoured within the plan. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first two input lines are the integers, smaller than 100, <br><br>n - the number of lines in the map, and <br><br>m - the number of characters per line in the map. <br><br>The following n lines, each with m characters, have only two valid character values: <br><br># - (sharp) representing a block of a wall; <br><br>. - (dot) representing part of the floor. <br><br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Your program must write either YES if the given labyrinth is a left labyrinth or NO otherwise </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">30
