Dec. 28, 1903, d. Feb. 8, 1957, was a Hungarian-American mathematician who made important contributions to the foundations of mathematics, logic, quantum physics,meteorology, science, computers, and game theory. He was noted for a phenomenal memory and the speed with which he absorbed ideas and solved problems. In 1925 he received a B.S. diploma in chemical engineering from Zurich Institute and in 1926 a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Budapest. His Ph.D. dissertation on set theory was an important contribution to the subject. At the age of 20, von Neumann proposed a new definition of ordinal numbers that was universally adopted. While still in his twenties, he made many contributions in both pure and applied mathematics that established him as a mathematician of unusual depth. His Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics (1932) built a solid framework for the new scientific discipline. During this time he also proved the mini-max theorem of GAME THEORY. He gradually expanded his work in game theory, and with coauthor Oskar Morgenstern he wrote Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944).<br>There are some numbers which can be expressed by the sum of factorials. For example 9,9=1!+2!+3! Dr. von Neumann was very interested in such numbers. So, he gives you a number n, and wants you to tell him whether or not the number can be expressed by the sum of some factorials.<br>Well, it's just a piece of cake. For a given n, you'll check if there are some xi, and let n equal to Î£<sub>1<=i<=t</sub>x<sub>i</sub>!. (t >=1 1, xi >= 0, xi = xj iff. i = j). If the answer is yes, say "YES"; otherwise, print out "NO".</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">You will get several non-negative integer n (n <= 1,000,000) from input file. Each one is in a line by itself.<br>The input is terminated by a line with a negative integer.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each n, you should print exactly one word ("YES" or "NO") in a single line. No extra spaces are allowed.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">9
