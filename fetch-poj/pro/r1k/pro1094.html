For example, the sorted sequence A, B, C, D implies that A < B, B < C and C < D. in this problem, we will give you a set of relations of the form A < B and ask you to determine whether a sorted order has been specified or not. </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input consists of multiple problem instances. Each instance starts with a line containing two positive integers n and m. the first value indicated the number of objects to sort, where 2 <= n <= 26. The objects to be sorted will be the first n characters of the uppercase alphabet. The second value m indicates the number of relations of the form A < B which will be given in this problem instance. Next will be m lines, each containing one such relation consisting of three characters: an uppercase letter, the character "<" and a second uppercase letter. No letter will be outside the range of the first n letters of the alphabet. Values of n = m = 0 indicate end of input.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each problem instance, output consists of one line. This line should be one of the following three:<br><br>Sorted sequence determined after xxx relations: yyy...y.<br>Sorted sequence cannot be determined.<br>Inconsistency found after xxx relations.<br><br>where xxx is the number of relations processed at the time either a sorted sequence is determined or an inconsistency is found, whichever comes first, and yyy...y is the sorted, ascending sequence.<br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 6
