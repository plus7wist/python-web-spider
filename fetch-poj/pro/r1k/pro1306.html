Challenges are the stuff of contests. Therefore, you are to make just such a computation given the following: <br>GIVEN: 	5 <= N <= 100; 5 <= M <= 100; M <= N<br>Compute the EXACT value of: 	C = N! / (N-M)!M!<br>You may assume that the final value of C will fit in a 32-bit Pascal LongInt or a C long. For the record, the exact value of 100! is: <br> 93,326,215,443,944,152,681,699,238,856,266,700,490,715,968,264,381,621,        468,592,963,895,217,599,993,229,915,608,941,463,976,156,518,286,253,      697,920,827,223,758,251,185,210,916,864,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input to this program will be one or more lines each containing zero or more leading spaces, a value for N, one or more spaces, and a value for M. The last line of the input file will contain a dummy N, M pair with both values equal to zero. Your program should terminate when this line is read. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output from this program should be in the form: <br>N things taken M at a time is C exactly. <br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">100  6
20  5
18  6
0  0

20 things taken 5 at a time is 15504 exactly.
18 things taken 6 at a time is 18564 exactly.</pre><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>UVA Volume III 369</a></div></td></tr></table>
