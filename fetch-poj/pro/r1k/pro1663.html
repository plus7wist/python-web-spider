For example, 1, 2, and 3 has been written at points (1,1), (2,0), and (3, 1) respectively and this pattern has continued.<br><center><img src=images/1663_1.jpg></center><br>You are to write a program that reads the coordinates of a point (x, y), and writes the number (if any) that has been written at that point. (x, y) coordinates in the input are in the range 0...5000.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input is N, the number of test cases for this problem. In each of the N following lines, there is x, and y representing the coordinates (x, y) of a point.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each point in the input, write the number written at that point or write No Number if there is none.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3
