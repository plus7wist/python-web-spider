A spanning tree of G is a subgraph of G, say T = (V', E'), with the following properties:<br>1. V' = V.<br>2. T is connected and acyclic.<br><br>Definition 2 (Minimum Spanning Tree): Consider an edge-weighted, connected, undirected graph G = (V, E). The minimum spanning tree T = (V, E') of G is the spanning tree that has the smallest total cost. The total cost of T means the sum of the weights on all the edges in E'.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 20), the number of test cases. Each case represents a graph. It begins with a line containing two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 100), the number of nodes and edges. Each of the following m lines contains a triple (xi, yi, wi), indicating that xi and yi are connected by an edge with weight = wi. For any two nodes, there is at most one edge connecting them.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each input, if the MST is unique, print the total cost of it, or otherwise print the string 'Not Unique!'.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">2
