Their network of transmitters and users can be represented as a tree. The root of the tree is a transmitter that emits the football match, the leaves of the tree are the potential users and other vertices in the tree are relays (transmitters).<br>The price of transmission of a signal from one transmitter to another or to the user is given. A price of the entire broadcast is the sum of prices of all individual signal transmissions.<br>Every user is ready to pay a certain amount of money to watch the match and the TV-network then decides whether or not to provide the user with the signal.<br>Write a program that will find the maximal number of users able to watch the match so that the TV-network's doesn't lose money from broadcasting the match.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains two integers N and M, 2 <= N <= 3000, 1 <= M <= N-1, the number of vertices in the tree and the number of potential users.<br>The root of the tree is marked with the number 1, while other transmitters are numbered 2 to N-M and potential users are numbered N-M+1 to N.<br>The following N-M lines contain data about the transmitters in the following form:<br>K A1 C1 A2 C2 ... AK CK<br>Means that a transmitter transmits the signal to K transmitters or users, every one of them described by the pair of numbers A and C, the transmitter or user's number and the cost of transmitting the signal to them.<br>The last line contains the data about users, containing M integers representing respectively the price every one of them is willing to pay to watch the match.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first and the only line of the output file should contain the maximal number of users described in the above text.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">9 6
