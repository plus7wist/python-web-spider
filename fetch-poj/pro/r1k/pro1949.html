At FJ's house, some chores cannot be started until others have been completed, e.g., it is impossible to wash the cows until they are in the stalls.<br><br>Farmer John has a list of N (3 <= N <= 10,000) chores that must be completed. Each chore requires an integer time (1 <= length of time <= 100) to complete and there may be other chores that must be completed before this chore is started. We will call these prerequisite chores. At least one chore has no prerequisite: the very first one, number 1. Farmer John's list of chores is nicely ordered, and chore K (K > 1) can have only chores 1,.K-1 as prerequisites. Write a program that reads a list of chores from 1 to N with associated times and all perquisite chores. Now calculate the shortest time it will take to complete all N chores. Of course, chores that do not depend on each other can be performed simultaneously.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: One integer, N<br><br>* Lines 2..N+1: N lines, each with several space-separated integers. Line 2 contains chore 1; line 3 contains chore 2, and so on.  Each line contains the length of time to complete the chore, the number of the prerequisites, Pi,  (0 <= Pi <= 100), and the Pi prerequisites (range 1..N, of course).<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A single line with an integer which is the least amount of time required to perform all the chores.<br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">7
