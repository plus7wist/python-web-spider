Each square of the chessboard is either black or white with the side of S milimiters, 0 < S <= 1000. The leftmost bottom square of the chessboard is black. A flea is positioned on the chessboard at the point (x, y) (given in milimeters) and makes jumps by jumping dx milimeters to the right and dy milimiters up, 0 < dx, dy, that is, a flea at position (x, y) after one jump lands at position (x+dx, y+dy). <br>Given the starting position of the flea on the board your task is to find out after how many jumps the flea will reach a white square. If the flea lands on a boundary between two squares then it does not count as landing on the white square. Note that it is possible that the flea never reaches a white square. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each test case consists of one line of input containing five non-negative numbers separated by white space and giving integers S, x, y, dx, and dy. An input line containing five zeroes follows the last test case.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For test case print one line of output in the format shown in the sample. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">10 2 3 3 2
