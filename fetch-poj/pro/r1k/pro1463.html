Now he has the following problem. He must defend a medieval city, the roads of which form a tree. He has to put the minimum number of soldiers on the nodes so that they can observe all the edges. Can you help him?<br>	<br>Your program should find the minimum number of soldiers that Bob has to put for a given tree. <br><br>For example for the tree:<br><center><img src=images/1463_1.jpg></center><br>the solution is one soldier ( at the node 1). </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several data sets in text format. Each data set represents a tree with the following description:<br><ul><br><li>	the number of nodes<br><li>	the description of each node in the following format<br>node_identifier:(number_of_roads) node_identifier<sub>1</sub> node_identifier<sub>2</sub> ... node_identifier<sub>number_of_roads</sub> <br>or <br>node_identifier:(0)<br></ul><br>	The node identifiers are integer numbers between 0 and n-1, for n nodes (0 < n <= 1500);the number_of_roads in each line of input will no more than 10. Every edge appears only once in the input data.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output should be printed on the standard output. For each given input data set, print one integer number in a single line that gives the result (the minimum number of soldiers). An example is given in the following:</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4
