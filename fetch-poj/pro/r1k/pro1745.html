One can place + or - operators between integers in the sequence, thus deriving different arithmetical expressions that evaluate to different values. Let us, for example, take the sequence: 17, 5, -21, 15. There are eight possible expressions: 17 + 5 + -21 + 15 = 16  <br>17 + 5 + -21 - 15 = -14  <br>17 + 5 - -21 + 15 = 58  <br>17 + 5 - -21 - 15 = 28  <br>17 - 5 + -21 + 15 = 6  <br>17 - 5 + -21 - 15 = -24  <br>17 - 5 - -21 + 15 = 48  <br>17 - 5 - -21 - 15 = 18  <br>We call the sequence of integers divisible by K if + or - operators can be placed between integers in the sequence in such way that resulting value is divisible by K. In the above example, the sequence is divisible by 7 (17+5+-21-15=-14) but is not divisible by 5. <br><br>You are to write a program that will determine divisibility of sequence of integers. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains two integers, N and K (1 <= N <= 10000, 2 <= K <= 100) separated by a space. <br>The second line contains a sequence of N integers separated by spaces. Each integer is not greater than 10000 by it's absolute value. <br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Write to the output file the word "Divisible" if given sequence of integers is divisible by K or "Not divisible" if it's not. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 7
