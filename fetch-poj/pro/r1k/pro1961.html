That is, for each i (2 <= i <= N) we want to know the largest K > 1 (if there is one) such that the prefix of S with length i can be written as A<sup>K</sup> ,that is A concatenated K times, for some string A. Of course, we also want to know the period K.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first one contains N (2 <= N <= 1 000 000) â€“ the size of the string S.The second line contains the string S. The input file ends with a line, having the<br>number zero on it.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output "Test case #" and the consecutive test case number on a single line; then, for each prefix with length i that has a period K > 1, output the prefix size i and the period K separated by a single space; the prefix sizes must be in increasing order. Print a blank line after each test case.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3
