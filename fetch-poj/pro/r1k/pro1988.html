They start with N stacks, each containing a single cube. Farmer John asks Betsy to perform P (1<= P <= 100,000) operation.  There are two types of operations:<br>moves and counts.<br>  * In a move operation, Farmer John asks Bessie to move the stack containing cube X on top of the stack containing cube Y.<br>  * In a count operation, Farmer John asks Bessie to count the  number of cubes on the stack with cube X that are under the cube X and report that value.<br><br>Write a program that can verify the results of the game.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: A single integer, P<br><br>* Lines 2..P+1: Each of these lines describes a legal operation. Line 2 describes the first operation, etc.  Each line begins with a 'M' for a move operation or a 'C' for a count operation.  For move operations, the line also contains two integers: X and Y.For count operations, the line also contains a single integer: X.<br><br>Note that the value for N does not appear in the input file. No move operation will request a move a stack onto itself.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Print the output from each of the count operations in the same order as the input file.<br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">6
