Next the second player should choose a number y1 such that y1 - x1 lies in [a, b] (Attention! This implies y1 > x1 since a > 0). Then the first player should choose a number x2 such that x2 - y1 lies in [a, b]... The game ends when one of them cannot make a choice. Note that a player MUST NOT skip his turn.<br><br>A player's score is determined by the numbers he has chose, by the way: <br><br>player1score = x1 + x2 + ...<br>player2score = y1 + y2 + ...<br><br>If you are player1, what is the maximum score difference (player1score - player2score) you can get? It is assumed that player2 plays perfectly.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 20) indicating the number of test cases. Then follow the t cases. Each case contains exactly two lines. The first line contains three integers, n, a, b (2 <= n <= 10000, 0 < a < b <= 100); the second line contains n integers, the numbers in the pool, any of which lies in [-9999, 9999].</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each case, print the maximum score difference player1 can get. Note that it can be a negative, which means player1 cannot win if player2 plays perfectly.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3
