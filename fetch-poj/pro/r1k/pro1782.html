The first character is the length of the sequence, represented by one of the characters 2 through 9. The second character is the value of the repeated character. A sequence of more than 9 identical characters is dealt with by first encoding 9 characters, then the remaining ones. <br><br>Any sequence of characters that does not contain consecutive repetitions of any characters is represented by a 1 character followed by the sequence of characters, terminated with another 1. If a 1 appears as part of the sequence, it is escaped with a 1, thus two 1 characters are output. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of letters (both upper- and lower-case), digits, spaces, and punctuation. Every line is terminated with a newline character and no other characters appear in the input. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each line in the input is encoded separately as described above. The newline at the end of each line is not encoded, but is passed directly to the output. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">AAAAAABCCCC
