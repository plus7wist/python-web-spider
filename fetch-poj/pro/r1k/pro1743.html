It is unfortunate but true that this representation of melodies ignores the notion of musical timing; but, this programming task is about notes and not timings. <br>Many composers structure their music around a repeating &qout;theme&qout;, which, being a subsequence of an entire melody, is a sequence of integers in our representation. A subsequence of a melody is a theme if it: <br><ul><li>is at least five notes long <br><li>appears (potentially transposed -- see below) again somewhere else in the piece of music <br><li>is disjoint from (i.e., non-overlapping with) at least one of its other appearance(s) </ul><br>Transposed means that a constant positive or negative value is added to every note value in the theme subsequence. <br>Given a melody, compute the length (number of notes) of the longest theme. <br>One second time limit for this problem's solutions! <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains the integer N. The following n integers represent the sequence of notes.<br>The last test case is followed by one zero. <br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, the output file should contain a single line with a single integer that represents the length of the longest theme. If there are no themes, output 0. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">30
