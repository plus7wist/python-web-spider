Each instance consists of a single integer n, where 1 <= n <= 500,000,000. A value of n = 0 terminates input. (Note that this means you will never have to output the empty tree.)</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each problem instance, you should output one line containing the tree corresponding to the order number for that instance. To print out the tree, use the following scheme:<br><br>A tree with no children should be output as X.<br>A tree with left and right subtrees L and R should be output as (L')X(R'), where L' and R' are the representations of L and R.<br>  If L is empty, just output X(R').<br>  If R is empty, just output (L')X.<br></div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1
