Therefore some sort of shuttle arrangement must be arranged in order to row the boat back and forth so that all people may cross. Each person has a different rowing speed; the speed of a couple is determined by the speed of the slower one. Your job is to determine a strategy that minimizes the time for these people to get across.</div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input contains a single integer T (1 <= T <= 20), the number of test cases. Then T cases follow. The first line of each case contains N, and the second line contains N integers giving the time for each people to cross the river. Each case is preceded by a blank line. There won't be more than 1000 people and nobody takes more than 100 seconds to cross.</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, print a line containing the total number of seconds required for all the N people to cross the river.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1
