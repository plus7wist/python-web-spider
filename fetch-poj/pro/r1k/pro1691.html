Each brush has a distinct color C. The APM picks one brush with color C and paints all possible rectangles having predefined color C with the following restrictions:<br>To avoid leaking the paints and mixing colors, a rectangle can  only  be painted if all rectangles immediately above it have already  been painted. For example rectangle labeled F in Figure 1 is painted only after rectangles C and D are painted. Note that each rectangle must be painted at once, i.e. partial painting of one rectangle is not allowed.<br>You are to write a  program for APM  to paint a  given  board  so that the number of  brush pick-ups is minimum.  Notice that if one brush is picked up more than once, all pick-ups are counted.<br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains an integer M which is the number of test cases to solve  (1 <= M <= 10). For each test case, the first line contains an integer N, the number of rectangles, followed by N lines describing the rectangles. Each rectangle R is specified by 5 integers in one line: the y and x coordinates of the upper left corner of R, the y and x coordinates of the lower right corner of R, followed by the color-code of R.<br>Note that: <br><ol><li>Color-code is an integer in the range of 1 .. 20.<br><li>Upper left corner of the board coordinates is always (0,0).<br><li>Coordinates are in the range of 0 .. 99.<br><li>N is in the range of 1..15.</ol><br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">One line for each test case showing the minimum number of brush pick-ups. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">1
