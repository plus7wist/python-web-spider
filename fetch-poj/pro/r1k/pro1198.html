The rows and columns of the chessboard are numbered from 1 to 8, from the top to the bottom and from left to right respectively. <br><br>There are four identical pieces on the board. In one move it is allowed to: <br><ul><br><li>move a piece to an empty neighboring field (up, down, left or right), <br><li>jump over one neighboring piece to an empty field (up, down, left or right). <br></ul><br><center><img src=images/1198_1.jpg></center><br>There are 4 moves allowed for each piece in the configuration shown above. As an example let's consider a piece placed in the row 4, column 4. It can be moved one row up, two rows down, one column left or two columns right. <br>Write a program that: <br><ul><br><li>reads two chessboard configurations from the standard input, <br><li>verifies whether the second one is reachable from the first one in at most 8 moves, <br><li>writes the result to the standard output. <br></ul></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each of two input lines contains 8 integers a1, a2, ..., a8 separated by single spaces and describes one configuration of pieces on the chessboard. Integers a2j-1 and a2j (1 <= j <= 4) describe the position of one piece -- the row number and the column number respectively. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output should contain one word YES if a configuration described in the second input line is reachable from the configuration described in the first input line in at most 8 moves, or one word NO otherwise. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">4 4 4 5 5 4 6 5
