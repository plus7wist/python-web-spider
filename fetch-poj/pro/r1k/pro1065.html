The length and weight of each stick are known in advance. The sticks are to be processed by a woodworking machine in one by one fashion. It needs some time, called setup time, for the  machine  to  prepare  processing  a  stick.  The  setup  times  are  associated  with  cleaning  operations  and changing tools and shapes in the machine. The setup times of the woodworking machine are given as follows: <br> (a) The setup time for the first wooden stick is 1 minute. <br> (b) Right after processing a stick of length  l  and weight  w , the machine will need no setup time for a stick of length  l'  and weight  w'  if l <= l' and  w <= w'. Otherwise, it will need 1 minute for setup. <br>You are to find the minimum setup time to process a given pile of  n  wooden sticks. For example, if you have five sticks whose pairs of length and weight are  ( 9 , 4 ) ,  ( 2 , 5 ) ,  ( 1 , 2 ) ,  ( 5 , 3 ) , and  ( 4 , 1 ) , then the minimum setup time should be 2 minutes since there is a sequence of pairs  ( 4 , 1 ) ,  ( 5 , 3 ) ,  ( 9 , 4 ) ,  ( 1 , 2 ) ,  ( 2 , 5 ) . </div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of T  test cases. The number of test cases  (T)  is given in the first line of the input file. Each test  case  consists  of  two  lines: The  first  line  has  an  integer  n ,  1 <= n <= 5000 ,  that  represents  the  number  of wooden  sticks  in  the  test case, and  the  second  line  contains  2n  positive  integers  l1 ,  w1 ,  l2 ,  w2 ,..., ln ,  wn , each  of  magnitude  at  most 10000 ,  where  li  and  wi  are  the  length  and  weight  of  the  i th  wooden  stick, respectively. The  2n  integers are delimited by one or more spaces. </div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output should contain the minimum setup time in minutes, one per line. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">3
