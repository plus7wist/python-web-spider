A well known system is that one where a number is associated to a character sequence. It is considered that the words are made only of small characters of the English alphabet a,b,c, ..., z (26 characters). From all these words we consider only those whose letters are in lexigraphical order (each character is smaller than the next character).<br><br>The coding system works like this: <br>•	The words are arranged in the increasing order of their length.<br>•	The words with the same length are arranged in lexicographical order (the order from the dictionary). <br>•	We codify these words by their numbering, starting with a, as follows:<br>a 	- 1   <br>b 	- 2<br>...<br>z 	- 26<br>ab 	- 27<br>...<br>az 	- 51<br>bc 	- 52<br>...<br>vwxyz 	- 83681<br>...<br><br>Specify for a given word if it can be codified according to this coding system. For the affirmative case specify its code. <br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The only line contains a word. There are some constraints:<br>•	The word is maximum 10 letters length<br>•	The English alphabet has 26 characters.<br></div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output will contain the code of the given word, or 0 if the word can not be codified. </div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">bf</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3><pre class="sio">55</pre><h3>Source</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><a>Romania OI 2002</a></div></td></tr></table>
