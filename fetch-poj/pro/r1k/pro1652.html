These pieces contain many holes, some so big that entire other piece of cloth may fit into them. Digital black-and-white image of the tabletop was taken, on which areas covered by cloth are represented with '*'s and not covered areas with '.'s. A single piece of cloth is thus represented with 4-connected area of '*'s - i.e., a group of '.'s located next to each other horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.<br><table border=1><tr><td><pre>.***..***<br>.*.*.**.*<br>.***.*.**<br>*...**.*.</pre></td><td>For example, on the image on the left there are three pieces - one without holes, and two with one hole each - first has area of 8, and the second - area of 12.</td></tr></table><br>Your goal is to find the piece with the most holes in it. The hole is a 4-connected area of '.'s completely surrounded with '*'s. If several pieces have the same number of holes, you must select the one with the smallest area.<br><br></div><h3>Input</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">In the first line of input there are two numbers W and H (1 <= W <= 100, 1 <= H <= 100), separated by spaces. Next H lines contain W characters each. Characters in these lines are either '*' (ASCII 42) or '.' (ASCII 46).</div><h3>Output</h3><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output must contain a single integer - the area of the smallest of most holey pieces. If there are no pieces with the holes, the output file must contain zero.</div><h3>Sample Input</h3><pre class="sio">9 5
